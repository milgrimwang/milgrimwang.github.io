<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-enable-rcs"><span>How to enable RCS</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hvNZmGdNTxGzturRQxDdn6" name="iPhone-15-Pro-Max-NEW-LIST.jpg" alt="iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvNZmGdNTxGzturRQxDdn6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First of all, it’s a good idea to check that RCS is enabled on your iPhone or Android phone. </p><p>On iPhone, head to <strong>Settings > Apps > Messages > RCS Messaging</strong>, and <strong>slide the toggle to On</strong>. </p><p>Most modern Android phones have RCS enabled by default, but to be sure, <strong>head to the Google Messages app</strong>,<strong> tap on your profile picture</strong>, <strong>scroll down to the Messages Settings</strong> section, and <strong>tap the RCS chats tab</strong> to find a similar toggle. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-benefits"><span>Benefits </span></h3>
<h2 id="1-group-chats-2">1. Group chats</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZxwuxB4kBprbDtPfM8quQ" name="imessage hero.jpg" alt="Group chats on iMessage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZxwuxB4kBprbDtPfM8quQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Creating a group chat between iPhone and Android users without using a third-party app like WhatsApp was previously possible – with some major caveats. </p><p>A group chat between iPhone users offers everyone involved the full set of iMessage features, like audio messages, tapback reactions, and Memoji stickers. Adding an Android user to the mix, however, would previously cause all of these features to disappear, as the entire chat is switched over to MMS.</p><p>RCS doesn’t replicate all of the functions of iMessage, but it does at least allow for the sending of high-quality media, audio messages, and a smaller range of tapback reactions.</p><p>This has the dual effect of allowing everyone in a group chat to use these modern features, and putting less pressure on Android users who want to join iPhone-only conversations.</p>
<h2 id="2-high-quality-media-2">2. High-quality media</h2>
<p>Messaging between iPhone and Android phones has, until now, been limited to the SMS/MMS standard, which only allows users to send and receive text, images, and videos up to a maximum of 5MB, or 30 seconds for video. </p><p>Due to this small file size limit, media sent over MMS often has to be heavily compressed, meaning the recipient may receive pixelated images and video (for reference, one minute of uncompressed 1080p MP4 video takes up about 20MB).</p><p>The RCS standard coming to iPhone supports a maximum file size of 105MB per message, meaning images and video can be sent and received in high quality. That said, you may still need to use a dedicated file transfer or storage service for larger files. </p>
<h2 id="3-read-receipts-xa0-2">3. Read receipts </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gLGSHro9oBPGMDXWWTqrmj" name="Untitled design (2).jpg" alt="The Beeper Mini app on a phone showing messages and images from iMessage. A little android robot hides behind the phone with a chat bubble saying "Feeling Blue"." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLGSHro9oBPGMDXWWTqrmj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Beeper)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What’s the one thing worse than being left on read? Not knowing whether you’ve been left on read.</p><p>Read receipts – the notes or symbols that tell you when your recipient has seen your message – are a source of certainty that most users take for granted. </p><p>SMS and MMS messages lack the time-stamped read receipts found on nearly every other messaging service. iOS 18 and RCS finally bring this now basic feature to cross-platform messaging.</p>
<h2 id="4-typing-indicators-xa0-2">4. Typing indicators  </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cQ8GzNWReHFt77d6b4zZbm" name="group-chat.jpg" alt="A group chat in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cQ8GzNWReHFt77d6b4zZbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It can be hard to get a sense of the flow of a conversation when you’re looking at a screenful of text, which is why typing indicators are so valuable. </p><p>Often represented as a message bubble containing animated ellipses, these notifications pop up on screen when someone is typing. </p><p>RCS support enables typing indicators for cross-platform messaging, so you’ll be able to see when your friends are getting their responses ready no matter the platform. </p>
<h2 id="5-location-sharing-xa0-2">5. Location sharing </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JnBqtqrVVKKSBQk2CUAj4C" name="Google Maps & Apple Maps.png" alt="Google Maps and Apple Maps logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnBqtqrVVKKSBQk2CUAj4C.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TechRadar)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>iMessage, and third party apps like WhatsApp, allow users to share a location within an interactive map, which has become a key feature for safety and convenience.</p><p>Apple’s implementation of RCS allows users to share a location pin within text conversations.</p><p>This doesn’t match the live tracking functionality of iMessage or third party apps like WhatsApp, but again, it’s a step in the right direction. </p>
<h2 id="6-send-messages-over-wi-fi-xa0-2">6. Send messages over Wi-Fi </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kE8QMi9ezMCh6QJLrWZjJc" name="AppleiMessage.jpg" alt="An iPhone on a blue background showing an iMessage conversation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kE8QMi9ezMCh6QJLrWZjJc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RCS brings more options to stay connected by allowing users to chat over mobile data and Wi-Fi. For comparison, MMS messages can only be sent over a cellular network. </p><p>This has long been a selling point of third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Signal, but these apps lack the ability to access cellular networks. For comparison, iMessage already supported Wi-Fi, mobile data, and cellular network compatibility.</p>
<p>Overall, that&apos;s a solid handful of new features, but there is more Apple could do to make RCS messaging on iPhone even better. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-downsides"><span>Downsides</span></h3>
<h2 id="1-no-encryption-x2013-seriously-xa0-2">1. No encryption – seriously </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7RBCnZZWVhhojZ9bxPPABE" name="Check In on Iphone - an open iMessage conversation.png" alt="Message thread open on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7RBCnZZWVhhojZ9bxPPABE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RCS protocol supports end-to-end encryption, meaning your message is scrambled into code before being sent to the recipient, whose device has the unique key needed to decipher your message. In theory, unencrypted messages can be intercepted by third parties as they are transmitted from sender to receiver. </p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24194362/rcs-iphone-ios-18-preview" target="_blank"><u>The Verge</u></a> notes, Apple has opted to use the basic version of RCS – the Universal Profile – to add end-to-end encryption to its implementation of RCS, meaning iMessage is still the only way to send encrypted messages through Apple’s first party service. </p><p>We aren’t a fan of this move by Apple. Companies need to differentiate their products, but doing so by offering suboptimal security is genuinely anti-consumer. </p>
<h2 id="2-no-video-calling-xa0-2">2. No video calling </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="ETJ9ZnMs24kpDkSYHmp8wD" name="Shutterstock_1913147464.jpg" alt="Google Meet on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETJ9ZnMs24kpDkSYHmp8wD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="545" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shutterstock.com / sdx15)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While RCS supports video calling, it’s easy to see why Apple hasn’t included this in its basic messaging service. </p><p>FaceTime was so impactful that this branded name is still used as a generic term for video calling 14 years after it was first introduced. </p><p>Apple likely wants to keep its first-party video calling options centralized. Android users can join FaceTime calls from a web browser via a link sent from an Apple user, but they can’t initiate a call themselves. </p>
<h2 id="3-green-bubbles-are-here-to-stay-xa0-2">3. Green bubbles are here to stay  </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VWztHZCeLzCoRbvRuRRwXH" name="iPhoneRCS.jpg" alt="An iPhone on a blue and green background showing an RCS message conversation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWztHZCeLzCoRbvRuRRwXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The famous – or infamous, depending on who you ask – green text bubbles associated with Android phones are here to stay.</p><p>Practically, these green bubbles simply signal that a message originates from outside Apple’s iMessage protocol, but the otherness this implies has inspired enough stigma to fuel an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/28/1241473453/why-green-text-bubble-stigma-is-part-of-the-anti-trust-case-against-apple#:~:text=Apple%20has%20long%20defended%20the,a%20tech%20conference%20in%202022.&text=UNIDENTIFIED%20PERSON:%20Not%20to%20make,Buy%20your%20mom%20an%20iPhone.&text=ALLYN:%20So%20to%20Anderson%20in,Bobby%20Allyn%2C%20NPR%20News." target="_blank"><u>anti-trust case</u></a>, countless memes, and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFXHPfI2JoI" target="_blank"><u>entire song by global rap star Drake</u></a>. </p><p>This effect is probably amplified by Apple’s large market share in the US, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266572/market-share-held-by-smartphone-platforms-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">hovers around 55%</a>. A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/79-of-gen-z-us-consumers-prefer-iphones-to-rivals-finds-bloomberg-intelligence/" target="_blank">Bloomberg Intelligence</a> found that 79% of Generation Z prefer iPhone to Android – this is a demographic which includes teenagers who are growing up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/" target="_blank"><u>increasingly reliant on technology for their social lives</u></a>.</p><p>So, as pointless as the stigma around green texts is, it is real, and we hope that RCS implementation helps to allay this bizarre phenomenon. </p>

We got a first look at Bailey&apos;s appearance in the new <em>Heartstopper </em>season 3 trailer (see below) as Charlie and his boyfriend Nick Nelson (Kit Connor) meet him at a book launch where a shy Nick struggles to form a sentence, before gushing about how attractive he is.</p>

<p>That&apos;s not the only exciting addition to the cast though as the trailer offered us a first look at Hayley Atwell (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/paramount-plus/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-is-coming-to-paramount-plus-next-week"><em>Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One</em></a>) as Nick&apos;s aunt Diane who offers him advice about his relationship with Charlie, and Eddie Marsan (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/netflixs-first-trailer-for-rapmans-supacell-series-shows-off-superheroes-and-time-travel-in-south-london"><em>Supacell</em></a>) as Charlie&apos;s wise therapist, Geoff.</p><p>Meanwhile, the trailer also teases emotional turmoil for Charlie and Nick as they face their biggest challenges yet and we get a glimpse at the other personal struggles the teens are set to face, with Elle (Yasmin Finney) confiding in Tao (William Gao) about her gender dysphoria.

<p><em>Heartstopper</em> series creator and writer Alice Oseman told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/heartstopper-season-3" target="_blank">Tudum</a> that the story for season 3, which was one of most notable projects that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/netflix-aggressively-taking-action-after-huge-data-breach-sees-full-episodes-of-arcane-season-2-heartstopper-season-3-and-more-leak-online">leaked online after a huge Netflix data breach</a> in August, will focus on Nick "beginning to understand the extent of Charlie’s mental health issues". "Mental health, sex, university ambitions, and more: Nick, Charlie, and the <em>Heartstopper</em> teens are getting older, learning more about themselves and each other, and experiencing new desires, new fears, and new joys as they approach adulthood."</p><p><em>Heartstopper </em>season 3 will also offer something new to the dedicated fanbase while still staying true to its core message, as Oseman added: “I’m so excited because it’s going to feel like a really different season, and I love that we are doing something different. It would be easy to be like, ‘Oh, <em>Heartstopper</em> Season 3, let’s just do the same kind of thing that we’ve always done. People like it.’ But we are doing something that will feel very different, and people will be surprised, and I can’t wait.” </p><p>All of our favorite chracters are returning, with Tobie Donovan (Isaac), Corinna Brown (Tara), Kizzy Edgell (Darcy), Rhea Norwood (Imogen), and Jenny Walser (Tori) all navigating the trials and tribulations of being a teenager as they must learn to lean on the people they love when life throws a curveball. We can&apos;t wait!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google has introduced a new ‘Sanitize’ feature for its operating system for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. The feature is part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/features/chrome-os-a-better-linux-than-linux-so-you-can-forget-about-windows">ChromeOS</a> 128, the most recent version of Google’s operating system that started rolling out earlier this month, and it’s a kind of softer alternative to the existing ‘Powerwash’ ability.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-reset-a-chromebook">Powerwash</a> works similarly to factory reset functions on other devices. It wipes all user data such as files, any custom settings you’ve applied, and any apps you’ve installed, resulting in the Chromebook being returned to an essentially ‘blank’ state, ready for you to start fresh. </p><p>If you want to clean up your Chromebook without wiping out absolutely everything, that’s what the new Sanitize option is for. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/theres-a-new-sanitize-feature-on-your-chromebook-and-heres-what-it-does/" target="_blank">Chrome Unboxed spotted</a> the freshly introduced functionality but noted that you won’t find Sanitize by searching in your Chromebook’s settings because it’s that new.</p><p>So how do you find it? Just search for the Powerwash option, which will show up, and you’ll see the Sanitize button directly underneath it.</p><p>Google hasn’t provided any extensive documentation about this feature yet, but Chrome Unboxed provides a screenshot of a notification that tells us what Sanitize does in a nutshell. It reads:</p><p><em>"Getting unwanted pop-ups, or other unexpected behavior? Sometimes, apps and extensions that you install can change your ChromeOS settings without you knowing.</em></p><p><em>"This will disable extensions and reset your settings to safe defaults. Tabs, files, and cookies will be preserved."</em></p><p>It sounds pretty straightforward, and will just reset certain settings, leaving your files and installed apps in place. If your Chromebook is acting up, Sanitize will neutralize elements such as browser extensions and any settings that have been modified that might be causing trouble. Hopefully, this will cure your Chromebook of any odd behavior and have it running smoothly again, without needing to do a full reset (where you lose everything).</p>

<h2 id="how-sanitize-works-in-practice-2">How Sanitize works in practice</h2>
<p>Chrome Unboxed tried out the feature and found that after running Sanitize, a summary window is presented informing the user of what’s been changed. You can then revert any changes you’re not happy with, and also peruse suggestions of other settings to check out should you wish to dive deeper into other possibilities.</p><p>For those who don’t customize their Chromebook much, or don’t use a ton of Chrome extensions, this might not be all that big a deal - but it’s still handy to know about.</p><p>It’s certainly a useful way to untangle things that might be causing serious problems without doing anything too drastic that affects your device and data. Sanitize is not the most difficult troubleshooting or clean-up process to try, and it’s a handy measure to employ if you’re having issues with your Chromebook, and don’t want to go to Powerwashing extremes.</p>

<h2 id="fleetpanda-reacts-2">FleetPanda reacts</h2>
<p>The company kept a non-password-protected database containing 780,191 documents, with a total size of 193 GB. It held various .PDF, .JPG, and other files, which contained information on fuel and petroleum shipments to and from different companies, industries, and even pipelines. Other files included invoices, delivery tickets, but also driver applications, high-resolution images of driver’s licenses, and background checks that contained personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>The files were generated between 2019 and August 2024, and were listed as cache files. The invoices also contained billing and delivery information such as bill to, delivered to, delivered by, ticket, PO or order numbers, truck numbers, and other internal identifiers or tracking data.</p><p>Fowler said that he disclosed his findings to FleetPanda, which locked the database a few days later - without a word. Therefore, we don’t know how long the database was kept unlocked, if a third party was maintaining it, and if anyone accessed the contents before Fowler did.</p><p>We reached out to the company with these questions and will update the article accordingly.</p><p>With most companies being “data companies” these days, and with the omnipresence of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-cloud-computing-services">cloud computing</a>, the majority of firms are holding their data in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-cloud-storage">cloud storage</a>.

<p>Epic teases the Beach as "a great place to pursue relaxation" but with pirates on the prowl, while the Jungle is lush with plants that can heal you, but also ones that can deal damage like the Bomb and Stink Flowers that players can you to defend themselves.</p><p>While exploring, players can also find new weapons and gear, like the Pirate Musket, Flint-Knock Pistol, and dynamite-laden Boom Shield, which are standard issue weapons dropped by Pirates.</p><p>There's also Throwing Spears from the Peely Tribe found in the Plains, while the Storm-Wild Tomatoes are known for carrying the Explorer's Machete and the Knockback Shield.</p><p>The Essence Table has been upgraded to the Rune Forge with the latest update, where players can craft Runes for strengthening tools.</p><p>While venturing through the Jungle environment, players may also encounter a new creature called Klombos. Feeding a Klombo a Klomberry can make them a friend and a mount, allowing players to travel greater distances much faster.</p>

<p>As with every major update, <em>Lost Isles</em> also arrives with a new Battle Pass. Called the Tropical Treasures Lego Pass, this version includes a bunch of unlockable build items for players to obtain.</p><p>The Premium Reward Track costs 1,400 V-Bucks and has 11 additional rewards to unlock, while also unlocking rewards from the free reward track.</p><p>Here’s how the Tropical Treasures Lego Pass works:</p>
<ul><li>After selecting the LEGO Fortnite experience in Fortnite, go to the LEGO Pass button in the top navigation.</li><li>Here is where you’ll see the LEGO Pass and a button to view Quests. These Quests are about exploring Lost Isles. Complete them to earn <strong>Studs</strong>!</li><li>The more Studs you collect, the further you’ll progress in the LEGO Pass! Unlock in-game rewards from the <strong>free reward track</strong> as you progress. If you want, you can also unlock in-game rewards from the purchasable <strong>Premium Reward Track</strong>.</li></ul>

The Tech giant first introduced hybrid quantum-safe encryption back in April based on the experimental Kyber TLS key exchange system and has now decided to switch to the new ML-KEM standard.</p><p>While the full implementation of quantum computing being a ways off still – experts estimate Q-day to happen between five and 10 years for now – it&apos;s just a matter of time before current encryption methods become obsolete. Hackers know that and they&apos;ve already begun executing what&apos;s known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/quantum-race-how-are-cybercriminals-silently-stealing-the-trophy">store now, decrypt later (SNDL) attacks</a>." This is why it is crucial for all software providers using encryption to kick off the post-quantum transition as soon as possible.  </p>
<h2 id="switching-to-the-ml-kem-algorithm-xa0-2">Switching to the ML-KEM algorithm  </h2>
<p>After over a decade of testing more than 80 algorithms, NIST released the first three quantum-resistant encryption standards last month which are designed for specific tasks.</p><p>The Module Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) is the primary standard for cryptographic key exchanges. This is essentially the process of protecting the exchange of information across a public network like in the case of web browsers or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn">best VPN</a> apps. The ML-KEM algorithm is based on what was previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, exactly what Chrome adopted back in April. </p><p>As Google explains in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/a-new-path-for-kyber-on-web.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>: "The changes to the final version of ML-KEM make it incompatible with the previously deployed version of Kyber.</p><p>"We do not want to regress any clients’ post-quantum security, so we are waiting until Chrome 131 to make this change so that server operators have a chance to update their implementations."</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-post-quantum-encryption-2">Why do we need post-quantum encryption?</h2>
<p>For the less techy out there, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/what-is-encryption">encryption</a> is the process of scrambling data into an unreadable form to make sure that only the sender and receiver can access the information.</p><p>For instance, today&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-protocol">VPN protocols</a> often leverage RSA-based key exchanges to ensure only you and your receiver can encrypt and decrypt the information. Web browsers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-chrome">Google Chrome</a> use a similar methods based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/features/what-is-tls-and-how-does-it-work">TLS</a> key exchange to secure your data in transit.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, today&apos;s encryption is set to eventually lose its effectiveness due to quantum computers&apos;s ability to process computations that stump current machines, within minutes. If you want some more technical details on how quantum computing breaks encryption, I suggest you watch the explainer below from Veritasium:</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UrdExQW0cs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The biggest takeaway here is that the cryptographic world must get ready to fight back against new security threats coming from a mass adoption of quantum computers.</p><p>The NIST standardized algorithms come, in fact, with instructions on how to implement them and their intended uses to better support developers to embark on their PQ transition.</p><p>At the time of writing, just a handful of VPN providers have already embraced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/vpn/post-quantum-encryption-standards-are-here-a-new-era-for-vpn-security-begins">new era of VPN security</a>, while more companies are working to upgrade their protections. Secure messaging app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/signal-is-adding-quantum-level-encryption-to-help-keep-customers-safe">Signal also added post-quantum</a> encryption last September. On July 2023, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-secure-email-providers">secure email</a> provider Tuta (formerly known as Tutanota) also shared its plans to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/computing-security/man-vs-machine-a-secure-email-firm-aim-to-bring-post-quantum-cryptography-to-the-cloud">post-quantum cryptography to the cloud</a> with its PQDrive project.</p><p>We expect more and more developers to join the PQ revolution. As experts at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards" target="_blank">NIST pointed out</a>, in fact, "full integration will take time." </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/ios/ios-18">iOS 18</a> has now landed with a host of new software toys, but the biggest one for photographers may be a handy new customizable lock screen trick. You can now replace Apple&apos;s basic Camera app in the lock screen with more powerful ones – like Halide and Moment&apos;s Pro Camera.</p><p>Halide Mk II and Pro Camera continue to be among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-camera-apps">best camera apps</a> around thanks to pro-grade features like manual focusing and bracketing. Thanks to updates for both, you can now put them on your lock screen, effectively bypassing the stock Camera here for the first time.</p><p>To do this, you need to update to both iOS 18 (go to Settings > General > Software Update) and have the latest version of Halide Mk II (2.16) or Pro Camera (5.5). Now, long-press your lock screen and tap the &apos;Customize&apos; button at the bottom of the screen. Tap the Lock screen on the left and you&apos;ll see the option to change your lock screen shortcuts.</p><p>Tap the Camera icon in the bottom right to remove it, then tap the &apos;+&apos; icon that takes its place. You&apos;ll now be given a much longer list of possible options, including the Halide and Moment apps in the &apos;Capture&apos; section.</p>

<p>Once you&apos;ve added your chosen camera app, hit &apos;done&apos;. You&apos;ll now be able to open Halide or Moment directly from the lock screen – and this time, all without the need to unlock your phone using Face ID or a password. </p><p>If you&apos;re looking for a powerful camera app that you can fire up in milliseconds, this could be quite a helpful upgrade. The only downside is that Halide II does require a subscription of £19.99 / £19.99 / AU$29.99 a year or $2.99 / £2.49 / AU$4.49 a month. There are also one-time purchase options of $59.99 / £59.99 / $99.99. Moment&apos;s app costs $8.99 / £8.99 / AU$14.99, but does contain further in-app purchases for other features.</p>

<p>There have long been calls for Apple to make a Pro version of its stock Camera app – and the recent arrival of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/apples-new-final-cut-camera-app-looks-great-for-shooting-video-but-id-still-love-a-photography-equivalent">Final Cut Camera</a>, which contains pro video controls, suggested that may just been on the cards.</p><p>Instead, it appears that Apple is happy simply making its stock Camera app for casual shooters, and letting third-party apps from the likes of Halide and Moment fill the gap for more demanding shooters – even now letting them live on its lock screen.</p><p>Those two apps aren&apos;t the only impressive third-party camera apps for the iPhone, with Obscura, Lightroom, and ProCam all being popular options for different reasons.</p><p>However, Halide and Moment are among the few to push out app updates that take advantage of this particular iOS 18 feature, letting you put them front and center on your lock screen at the expense of the stock Camera app. If you need to quickly take a shot using focus peaking, histograms, or more, that could be a very handy little tweak indeed. </p>

AVIC is the country’s aerospace and defense conglomerate.</p><p>While employed at AVIC, between 2017 and 2021, he was sending phishing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-secure-email-providers" target="_blank">emails</a> to people working at NASA, the Air Force, Navy, and Army, the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as people working at universities in Georgia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio.</p>
<h2 id="successful-phishing-2">Successful phishing</h2>
<p>In these emails, he was impersonating other people working at these organizations, casually asking for things such as source code, proprietary software, and similar. The software is used in aerospace engineering, missile and weapons development, and more.</p><p>One of the emails, showcased in the indictment, read: "Hi [Victim 2], I sent Stephen an email for a copy of NASCART-GT code, but got no response right now. He must be too busy. Will you help and sent (sic) it to me?"</p><p>NASCART-GT, short for Numerical Aerodynamics Simulation via CARTesian Grid Techniques, is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver developed at Georgia Tech. It simulates complex aerodynamics, including supersonic and hypersonic flows, for various aerospace applications.</p><p>Apparently, the strategy worked, as at least some people ended up giving Wu what he needed. The DoJ does not say what was stolen:</p><p>"In some instances, the targeted victim, believing that defendant SONG … was a colleague, associate, or friend requesting the source code or software electronically transmitted the requested source code or software to defendant Song."</p><p>Wu, 39, is now facing 14 counts of wire fraud, and 14 counts of aggravated identity theft. He remains at large, and if arrested, could face up to 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud, and two years for each count of aggravated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-identity-theft-protection" target="_blank">identity theft</a>, <em>The Register</em> reports.</p><p><em>Via </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/17/chinese_national_nasa_phishing_indictment/" target="_blank"><em>The Register</em></a></p>

Now, she&apos;s tackling true crime in her directing debut for <em>Woman of the Hour, </em>which arrives on Netflix on October 18.</p><p>We&apos;ve already seen a variety of announcements coming out of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/netflix-geeked-week-2024-what-is-it-start-date-live-event-movie-and-tv-show-line-up-and-more">Netflix Geeked Week</a>, and this latest one is arguably the most unsettling of them all. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare">best streaming service</a> has teased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-netflix-movies">new Netflix movie</a> with a creepy trailer that will chill anyone to the core.</p><p>While <em>Woman of the Hour </em>is not <em>technically </em>a horror movie – it&apos;s billed as a crime drama – our first look at the project is definitely scary. In a trailer that does not give much away (hooray!), we see Kendrick&apos;s Sheryl Bradshaw on an uncomfortable date with Rodney Alcala (<em>It Follows</em> star Daniel Zovatto). Unbeknownst to her, she is sitting opposite a very dangerous man.</p><p>Take a look at the trailer below.</p>

<h2 id="what-else-should-we-know-about-woman-of-the-hour-2">What else should we know about Woman of the Hour?</h2>
<p>To paint a clearer picture of the movie, it&apos;s based on a 1978 episode of <em>The Dating Game </em>where Rodney Alcala appeared alongside contestant Sheryl Bradshaw. But this seemingly average bachelor was hiding a horrifying secret: he was in the middle of a killing spree and had managed to get himself on TV to potentially do it again.</p><p>According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/03/08/dating.game.killer/index.html?hpt=T2" target="_blank"> CNN</a>, a criminal profiler suggested that Acala&apos;s rejection following the dating show could have been the catalyst for further murders. He eventually went on to be convicted of seven, though could have committed over 100, before dying in 2021.</p><p>The movie is based on this case, where Kendrick&apos;s movie "zeroes in on Alcala’s victims and the lives he cut short", according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/woman-of-the-hour-release-date-news">Tudum</a>. I&apos;m very excited to see this and hope it has the potential to join our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-netflix-movies">best Netflix movies </a>recommendations!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Last month <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/soundbars/sonos-next-soundbar-gets-a-reported-new-name-and-good-news-for-its-release-date">we reported that Sonos&apos; next soundbar, which was believed to be called the Sonos Arc Ultra</a>. And now a newly leaked image that looks very much like an official Sonos product page appears to confirm it, and has given it a price tag too.</p><p>The image <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1fi0xyn/did_anyone_see_the_ultra_soundbar_photo_last/" target="_blank">was shared to the r/sonos subreddit</a> and includes the image above. The copy calls the Arc Ultra the "Premium Smart Soundbar" (which is the exact same description as the original Sonos Arc) and says that it is "The definitive Home Theater soundbar. Enhanced with immersive Sound Motion technology. And did someone say &apos;Bluetooth&apos;?" The listed price: $1,199.</p><p>As ever with internet images, this could be a total fake. But it does fit with recent credible rumors, including a Google AI leak that appeared to share its specifications. We&apos;ve reached out to Sonos for comment and we&apos;ll update you with any response.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-think-we-know-about-the-sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar-2">What we think we know about the Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar</h2>
<p>The Sound Motion technology is almost certainly Sonos&apos;s name for HeartMotion, a technology developed by Mayht – a firm Sonos bought in 2022. HeartMotion promises a huge upgrade to speaker technology by delivering drivers that are much smaller than normal speakers and considerably lighter too, so they need less power to drive them. As Sonos explained when it took over the company, Mayht "has invented a new, revolutionary approach to audio transducers. Transducers are the foundational element within speakers that create sound, and Mayht has re-engineered them to enable smaller and lighter form factors without compromising on quality."</p><p>That makes the Arc Ultra really interesting, because it could mean better audio quality, and a more immersive sound stage. The presence of HeartMotion ties in with previous rumors that the codename Lasso soundbar would look like the Arc but deliver a massively improved sound, especially at the low end, which HeartMotion is especially suited to.</p><p>According to Google&apos;s AI, as shared to r/sonos last week, there are eight woofers and three tweeters in the Arc Ultra, backed by 11 Class D digital amps. There&apos;s support for Wi-Fi, Spotify Connect and Apple AirPlay 2, and it&apos;ll be the first Sonos soundbar with Bluetooth. However, Google&apos;s AI has also claimed that fatal mushrooms are safe to eat and that you should put glue in pizza, so maybe take that with a big pinch of salt for now.</p><p>If the leaked image is an accidental upload by Sonos&apos;s marketing people then a launch can&apos;t be far away. We&apos;re also expecting to see a new version of the Sonos Sub, which is likely to launch around the same time. </p><p>This price is higher than most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/home-cinema-audio/tr-top-10-best-soundbars-1288008">best soundbars</a> and is serious high-end stuff, but if can meet its potential of delivering fulsome bass and incredible 3D sound from a single bar, then it could be very special.</p>
