The most spectacular bug of all, shared by a Reddit user, was the appearance of a tide of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/1fhe841/do_not_play_ff16_on_performance_mode_what_is_this/"><ins>black squares</ins></a> approaching the player and covering much of the screen.</p>
<p>The official <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> account has made a post on X about the issues. In the post, Square Enix says that it is cooperating with Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) to determine the causes. The company also asked gamers to be patient and wait for further updates.</p>

<p>Sony hasn’t made any statements on the issues as of writing time. Players of other games have also posted about how they ran into similar bugs while playing other games.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the-sims/"><ins>The Sims</ins></a> has been one of the biggest success stories in gaming over the last quarter century, with more than 500 million players trying to understand Simish, learning what <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-sims-4s-lovestruck-expansion-lets-you-dive-into-a-steamy-polyamory-sandbox-193545470.html"><ins>WooHoo-ing</ins></a> is and using the classic Rosebud cheat to gain more money. All of that could be coming to a big screen near you, as Electronic Arts has <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims"><ins>revealed</ins></a> that Amazon MGM Studios is working on a movie adaptation of the games.</p>
<p>Kate Herron (<em>Loki, The Last of Us</em>) will direct the film and co-write the screenplay with Briony Redman (<em>Doctor Who</em>). One of the production companies that's on board is Margot Robbie's LuckyChap, which seems appropriate given that EA is looking "to make an impact the size of something like a <em>Barbie</em> movie," EA vice president and Sims general manager Kate Gorman said. (For the tape, <em>Barbie </em>is the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time.)</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>EA wants the movie to be an authentic experience for fans, particularly given that many people have "love and nostalgia" for the series. To that end, you can expect a lot of Sims lore and Easter eggs in the film.</p>
<p>“There will be <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Freezer_Bunny" data-original-link="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Freezer_Bunny">Freezer Bunnies</a>,” Gorman told <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/the-sims-movie-plot-details-amazon-ea-margot-robbie-1236142126/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a>. “I’m sure a pool without a ladder is somewhere in there, but we haven’t finalized any of those details. But that’s the idea, is to say that it lives within this space. It’s a nod to all of the amazing play and creation and fun that people have had over the last 25 years within The Sims.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, EA provided updates on The Sims franchise as a whole. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/"><ins>doesn't currently plan to release</ins><em><ins> The Sims 5</ins></em></a>, instead opting to focus on updating <em>The Sims 4 </em>and releasing paid expansions for the 10-year-old game. The publisher is also spinning up a creator program and some players who create custom in-game items will be able to sell them as Creator Kits.</p>
<p>While <em>The Sims 4 </em>will remain the core of the series, EA is looking at expanding the franchise in other ways, including with <em>Project Rene</em>, a cross-platform multiplayer experience that the publisher has been <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-sims-5-cross-platform-project-rene-ea-maxis-mobile-freeplay-185822870.html"><ins>talking up for a couple of years</ins></a>. An <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://go.ea.com/TSLblogsignup"><ins>invite-only playtest</ins></a> is scheduled for this fall.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-sims-movie-from-amazon-mgm-studios-is-on-the-way-161159048.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Apple just released <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-18-gets-a-revamped-control-center-and-loads-of-home-screen-customization-options-172350046.html">iOS 18</a> for all eligible iPhones to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-18-is-now-available-171444543.html">install </a>now; you can find it in the Software Update settings. And if you're planning to buy one of the new <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-iphone-16-gets-a-camera-button-action-button-and-the-a18-chip-174756253.html">iPhone 16</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-has-a-dslr-like-camera-button-and-a-slightly-bigger-display-181605027.html">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models coming available on September 20, they'll already have iOS 18 installed. But not every iPhone will be able to run iOS 18, and even the ones that can won't have all the bells and whistles of the new <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-what-devices-and-features-will-actually-be-supported-185850732.html">Apple Intelligence</a> features.</p>
<p>That update stratification is nothing now. Generally each year, some older iPhone models are removed from Apple's iOS eligibility list. Last year, for instance, the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X were left off the compatibility list. That meant those iPhone owners couldn't update to iOS 17 and missed out on some <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-17-review-notable-new-features-and-streamlined-touches-140009954.html">notable features</a>. On the flip side, some older hardware will get major new features: Consider the upcoming software update that effectively turns existing AirPods Pro headphones into a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-apples-hearing-aid-and-hearing-test-will-work-on-airpods-pro-154814439.html">hearing aid</a>, complete with a built-in hearing test. (Apple just <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-fda-greenlights-apples-hearing-aid-feature-for-airpods-pro-164912484.html">received FDA authorization</a> to release that feature later this year.)</p>

<p>If your device is compatible with Apple Intelligence, you can start playing with some of those features in October, when they begin to hit those newer iPhones in subsequent updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first round of Apple Intelligence features will be available in English in the US this October.

<p><strong>Personalized home screen layout:</strong> You'll finally get the option to rearrange your apps — for instance, you can leave the middle space open to display your home screen photo, and instead have your apps alone the border of the screen. You can also change the appearance of the apps by tinting them with any color, as well as making the apps larger.</p>

It’s bare bones, but gets the job done. We appreciated the compact design and the diminutive, yet useful, 5.5-inch screen. The compact size allows the Echo Show 5 to double as one heck of a smart alarm clock.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>To that end, there’s an ambient light sensor that adjusts the screen’s brightness automatically, a tap-to-snooze function and a sunrise alarm that slowly brightens the screen for a gentle wake up call. There’s also a camera for video calls and the like, which is great, and privacy concerns are assuaged by the physical camera cover that ships with the display.</p> 
<p>This is a smart display, so Amazon has packed in a Sengled smart light bulb. This is a decent way to learn the ins and outs of making smart home adjustments, but it’s just a colored light bulb. The only major downside with this display is that the speakers are tiny, to suit the rest of the device. This translates to reduced sound quality when compared to rival smart displays.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> is trying to be more transparent about whether a piece of content was created or modified using generative AI (GAI) tools. After joining the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) as a steering committee member earlier this year, Google has revealed how it will start implementing the group’s digital watermarking standard.</p>
<p>Alongside <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://c2pa.org/membership/"><ins>partners</ins></a> including Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI, Google has spent the past several months figuring out how to improve the tech used for watermarking GAI-created or modified content. The company says it helped to develop the latest version of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/can-digital-watermarking-protect-us-from-generative-ai-184542396.html"><ins>Content Credentials</ins></a>, a technical standard used to protect metadata detailing how an asset was created, as well as information about what has been modified and how. Google says the current version of Content Credentials is more secure and tamperproof due to stricter validation methods.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the coming months, Google will start to incorporate the current version of Content Credentials into some of its main products. In other words, it should soon be easier to tell whether an image was created or modified using GAI in Google Search results. If an image that pops up has C2PA metadata, you should be able to find out what impact GAI had on it via the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-about-this-image-update-july-2024/"><ins>About this image</ins></a> tool. This is also available in Google Images, Lens and Circle to Search.</p>
<p>The company is looking into how to use C2PA to tell YouTube viewers when footage was captured with a camera. Expect to learn more about that later this year.</p>
<p>Google also plans to use C2PA metadata in its ads systems. It didn&#39;t reveal too many details about how its plans there other than to say it will use &quot;C2PA signals to inform how we enforce key policies&quot; and do so gradually.</p>
<p>Of course, the effectiveness of this all depends on whether companies such as camera makers and the developers of GAI tools actually use the C2PA watermarking system. The approach isn&#39;t going to stop someone from stripping out an image&#39;s metadata either. That could make it harder for systems such as Google&#39;s to detect any GAI usage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, throughout this year, we&#39;ve seen Meta <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-plans-to-ramp-up-labeling-of-ai-generated-images-across-its-platforms-160234038.html"><ins>wrangle</ins></a> over how to disclose whether images were created with GAI across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. The company just <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/metas-approach-to-labeling-ai-generated-content-and-manipulated-media/"><ins>changed its policy</ins></a> to make labels less visible on images that were edited with AI tools. Starting this week, if C2PA metadata indicates that someone (for instance) used Photoshop&#39;s GAI tools to tweak a genuine photo, the &quot;AI info&quot; label no longer appears front and center. Instead, it&#39;s buried in the post&#39;s menu.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/heres-how-google-will-start-helping-you-figure-out-which-images-are-ai-generated-150219272.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Uber just announced the expansion of safety features directed toward drivers, including a national rollout of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/safety/rider-verification/?nocache=true">enhanced rider verification</a>, which begins tomorrow. If a rider undergoes these additional verification steps they’ll get a “Verified” badge on their account, which will let drivers know everything is on the up and up.</p>
<p>The company says it designed these new verification measures “in response to driver feedback that they want to know more about who is getting in their car.” The company began testing this feature earlier this year and it must have been a success, as it&#39;s getting a national rollout. Lyft has its own version of this tool, though it&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/transportation/lyft-is-testing-a-new-rider-verification-safety-measure-201515898.html">still being tested in select markets</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Uber verifies riders by cross-checking account information against third-party databases, though it’ll also accept official government IDs. The program will also allow users to bring in their verification status <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.clearme.com/clear-verified">from the CLEAR program</a>.</p>
<p>While rider ID is the most notable safety tool announced, Uber’s also bringing its Record My Ride feature to the whole country after <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/onlyonuber23/">another successful beta test</a>. This lets drivers record the entirety of the ride via their smartphone cameras, without the need to invest in a dashcam. The footage is fully encrypted, with Uber saying nobody can access it unless a driver sends it in for review. The company hopes this will allow it to “more quickly and fairly resolve any incidents that may arise.”</p>

<p>Drivers can now cancel any trip without a financial penalty and they can “unmatch” from any riders they don&#39;t feel comfortable picking up. Finally, there’s a new PIN verification feature in which drivers can request riders to enter a number to confirm they are, in fact, the correct guest.</p>
<p>Uber tends to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-makes-its-safety-tools-easier-to-access-and-customize-123036849.html">focus its resources</a> on <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/uber-teen-accounts-20-revealed-with-more-convenience-and-safety-features-142209566.html">riders over drivers</a>, so this is a nice change of pace. It is kind of a bummer, however, that drivers require this kind of enhanced verification system just to root out some bad apples and keep doing their jobs. In other words, don’t be a jerk during your next Uber ride.</p>
<p><strong>Correction, September 17 2024, 10:45AM ET:</strong> This story and its headline originally stated that Uber&#39;s rider verification program was rolling out nationwide as of today. The rollout starts tomorrow, September 18.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/essilorluxottica-and-meta-announce-long-term-partnership/">Meta and Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica have extended their partnership</a> into the next decade. The duo have collaborated since 2019, producing two generations of Ray-Ban Meta glasses. The agreement between Meta and EssilorLuxottica should bring more "multi-generational smart eyewear products."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-hands-on-160048150.html">first iteration launched in late 2021</a>, right before Meta became Facebook, and was known as Ray-Ban Stories. We weren't totally sold on them, though there were some good points. The $300 sunglasses looked like a slightly bulkier Ray-Ban with, thankfully, no Facebook logo on them and offered decent audio quality through their tiny speakers at mid-range volume. The camera was so-so and worked better in brighter light. But privacy is really where we had an issue with data sharing and audio transcriptions on by default.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We were more into the 2023 Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, giving them an <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review-instagram-worthy-shades-070010365.html">85 in our review</a>. The new model's perks include slimmer frames, hands-free photo messaging and <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-can-now-upload-photos-directly-to-instagram-stories-130019041.html">Instagram</a> livestreaming abilities (with an improved 12MP ultra-wide camera). It also offers better mics and sound quality — including at higher volumes. Plus, the charging case looks just like a classic Ray-Ban pouch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smart glasses originally came with an <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-new-ai-powers-are-impressive-and-worrying-181036772.html">AI assistant</a>, but Meta has since introduced <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-do-the-ai-thing-without-a-projector-or-subscription-175403559.html">Multimodal AI</a>. The <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-getting-ai-powered-visual-search-features-204556255.html">toolset</a> allows the assistant to see and comprehend the world in real-time, processing photos, videos, text, and audio. You can ask it to identify things you're looking at, such as a dog's breed, the name and <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ray-bans-meta-sunglasses-can-now-identify-and-describe-landmarks-054026843.html">information for landmarks</a>, and a road sign in a different language. Plus, there are new frame designs to choose from, starting at $300.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, in July, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/essilorluxottica-ceo-says-meta-would-be-welcome-shareholder-2024-07-25/" data-original-link="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/essilorluxottica-ceo-says-meta-would-be-welcome-shareholder-2024-07-25/">reports from the media</a> and EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri indicated Meta might take a five percent stake in the company. Whether that will happen is still up in the air, with no mention of a purchase in the extended partnership release.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-and-ray-bans-owner-extend-smart-glasses-partnership-140052046.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, who previously <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162667/bitcoin-scams-donald-trump">called Bitcoin a scam</a>, has launched a new cryptocurrency venture called World Liberty Financial. &quot;Crypto is one of those things we have to do,&quot; he said in an interview on X. &quot;Whether we like it or not, I have to do it.&quot; The news comes just a day after a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/16/us/trump-shooting-news?smid=url-share#heres-the-latest-on-the-investigation">likely assassination attempt</a> against Trump at his Florida golf course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump is entering the venture with his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, along with two crypto entrepreneurs: Chase Herro (who once called stablecoins &quot;borderline a Ponzi scheme&quot;) and Zachary Folkman, who founded a company called Date Hotter Girls. Trump&#39;s 18-year-old son Barron Trump, who has no known crypto expertise, is also listed as &quot;chief DeFi [decentralized finance] visionary.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tokens themself are supposedly based on US dollar stablecoins. Some involved in the venture have touted it internally as a borrowing and lending platform, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/technology/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is generally supposed to be decentralized, but a large chunk of the governance tokens for World Liberty Financial could be held by insiders, according to a draft white paper for the project seen by <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/09/04/in-trump-backed-crypto-project-insiders-are-poised-for-unusually-big-paydays/"><em>CoinDesk</em></a>. The remaining 30 percent would be distributed &quot;via public sale&quot; with some of the money raised from that also going to project insiders.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="580b78f3ab534de6a3bf44737de4329b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">lmao Trump has absolutely no clue what crypto is. Notice how he changes the topic immediately here to avoid talking about it. <a href="https://t.co/uPtL5qHPvs">pic.twitter.com/uPtL5qHPvs</a></p>— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1835840344107213081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>When asked questions about the venture in an X Spaces interview (above), Trump appeared to know next to nothing about it. &quot;It&#39;s so important. It&#39;s crypto. It&#39;s AI. It&#39;s so many other things. AI needs tremendous electricity capabilities beyond anything I ever heard,&quot; he said. He deferred to Barron&#39;s expertise, saying he has &quot;four wallets&quot; and equated it to learning a language like Chinese.</p>
<p>Some comments in the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://x.com/i/spaces/1jMJgBljZaYGL">Spaces interview</a> weren&#39;t kind. &quot;Let&#39;s be honest Trump doesn&#39;t even know what crypto is or why he&#39;s being asked to shill it,&quot; said one. Others noted that launching such a venture just ahead of an election was inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it genuinely damages trump’s electoral prospects, especially if it gets hacked (it’ll be the juiciest DeFi target ever and it’s forked from a protocol that itself was hacked),&quot; said crypto industry notable and self-proclaimed Trump supporter Nic Carter in a <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1831145983847137451">post on X</a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/trump-jumps-into-cryptocurrency-appears-to-know-nothing-about-it-130022525.html?src=rss]]></description>

The basic Switch system bundle with red and blue Joy-Cons will set you back $300. Nintendo already has an existing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL05pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaFRNLURvd25sb2FkLVN3aXRjaC1NZW1iZXJzaGlwLUluY2x1ZGVkL2RwL0IwQ0hCTjhRRDk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWQ5YmViZDItM2E2OS00OTBlLTkwNmYtOTM4OGJmYzY4MThmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL05pbnRlbmRvLVN3aXRjaFRNLURvd25sb2FkLVN3aXRjaC1NZW1iZXJzaGlwLUluY2x1ZGVkL2RwL0IwQ0hCTjhRRDkiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARhcRxqOkiuiW3Qrn4HbGmExvo1BquYCPmZDoG2meqRf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-SwitchTM-Download-Switch-Membership-Included%2Fdp%2FB0CHBN8QD9" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-Download-Switch-Membership-Included/dp/B0CHBN8QD9">Switch-Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle</a>, but it's selling for $360 and only comes with three months of Switch Online subscription instead of 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company will also sell an OLED model bundle with the same inclusions as the basic one for $350, $10 less than what the current package with the non-OLED system costs. Nintendo's <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998-130025862.html">OLED model</a> has a bigger screen than the standard model with better battery life. There's no time limit to get the bundles, but both options will only be available from the My Nintendo Store and in select retail stores until supplies last.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nintendo <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-the-coming-release-110023903.html">could announce the next-gen Switch</a> as soon as later this month. Based on previous reports, the new Switch will likely be fully backwards compatible for both digital and physical games. It is, of course, expected to have a more powerful processor than the first Switch, which was released way back in 2017, and could have 8GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The console is also expected to support NVIDIA's DLSS upscaling technology that would give the console the power to render games internally at a low resolution while producing a high-resolution output. It could either have an 8-inch display LCD display or a 7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, as well. The next-gen Switch will most likely be released sometime in 2025, though, and will not be available to purchase as a gift for others or yourself these holidays.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-will-sell-cheaper-switch-mario-kart-bundles-in-october-123024329.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Apple Watch has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-09-iwatch-hands-on.html">been around for ten years</a>. Looking at pictures of the device then, it might not seem like much has changed — even the apps drawer seems identical. But subtly and quietly, the Apple Watch – the company’s first new product line of the post-Steve Jobs era – has evolved to become capable of so much more today. Over the last few years, there have been some big leaps forward for the Apple Watch’s featureset, up to and including wrist-based ECG and heart-rate readings that were once the purview of science fiction. We’ve heard many testimonials, mostly from Apple at its events, about how the Apple Watch has saved lives — whether it be by detection of a fall or atrial fibrillation. Smartwatches as a category have matured and found their place, it seems, and the Apple Watch has carved out a comfy spot within the space.</p> 
<p>So color me surprised when <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-features-a-much-larger-screen-and-a-much-thinner-design-171307821.html">the Series 10 launched</a> to very little fanfare last week. I guess I was expecting Apple to be a bit more self-congratulatory, but the company seemed to gloss over the product’s birthday. Instead, we got to learn about the device’s thinner profile and bigger screen with greater viewing angles. It also has smaller onboard speakers, apps for water sports enthusiasts and health features like the new sleep apnea monitoring and alerts. It may sound underwhelming compared to the seemingly futuristic features we were seeing in the Apple Watch’s early days, but the Series 10 is just following in the footsteps of the iPhone. It’s a mature product that’s traded massive annual overhauls for iterative updates that add up over time. For a smartwatch that has consistently been called the best in its class, the Series 10 largely continues that tradition, even as it walks back a feature or two thanks to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-remove-blood-oxygen-app-from-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-to-evade-us-import-ban-194517839.html">ongoing copyright litigation</a>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p><strong><em>Editors’ Note</em></strong><em>: While we've been testing the Apple Watch Series 10 for about a week, there are some features — including sleep apnea alerts — that we'd like to spend more time evaluating. As such, we'll be returning to this review with further evaluation followed by a final rating in the near future.</em></p>

<h2 id="jump-link-design-and-display">Design and display</h2> 
<p>Compared to the Series 9, the latest Apple Watch is ever so slightly bigger and noticeably thinner and lighter. It’s not such a great difference that you’ll notice without having the two side by side, but every time I pick up the Series 10 I definitely feel a tiny spark of joy. The squatter shape, slimmer profile and more rounded corners somehow make the new watch feel a bit like a biscuit, while the Series 9 comes off more like a smaller mahjong tile.</p> 
<p>Both sizes of the mainstream Apple Watch have grown ever so slightly, with the 41mm version now coming in at 42mm and the 45mm one sitting at 46mm. I’ve worn the smaller Series 10 and Series 9 on both wrists for a few days now and genuinely don’t find there to be a major difference in daily use. As significant as I think the thinner body and lighter weight is on the Series 10, it’s not like I was having trouble squeezing its predecessor through jacket sleeves before. I will say that the new model will certainly be more comfortable under the snuggest of my cuffs.</p> 
<p>Apple cutting the Series 10 down to just 9.7mm thin is certainly a feat, considering the Pixel Watch 3 is still a pretty chunky 12mm thick. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 7 is the same height, so Google needs to play a bit of catch-up here.</p> 
<p>The Series 10’s bigger screen does make some things easier to see, like road names on Maps and the clock when you’re in Spotify. You’ll likely find greater gains here by choosing larger font sizes, which is a bit of an obvious note but at least on the Series 10 you’ll have more room to work with. If you need something even bigger, you should consider the Watch Ultra 2, which has a 49mm screen.</p> 
<p>Apple’s also using a wide-angle OLED this year to make things easier to read even if your wrist is simply resting on the table, not held up in front of your eyes. Again, in my side by side observations, the change is noticeable but not in a huge way. There does appear to be greater contrast between the digits of the time against the photo in the background, too, which makes the clock more visible at an angle.</p>

<p>However, it’s worth pointing out that when you’re staring at the Series 10 face on, you might find its bezels noticeably thicker than on the Series 9. Even if you’re planning on upgrading from a Series 9, where you’ll be most primed to feel the bigger bezels’ impact on design, it’s still a tiny complaint, if at all. Thicker borders don’t really affect the watch’s performance.</p> 
<p>Apple introduced some new watch faces with the Series 10, as it does with every successive generation. This time, the Flux face is supposed to make full use of the display’s wider angle view as it spills over the sides (sort of). There’s also a bit of an animation that mimics a second hand ticking across the screen, which is nice, but doesn’t add much to the experience.</p> 
<p>There are other small design changes around the watch. For example, instead of an inch-long slit on the left edge for the speaker output, there now sits two half-inch grilles which blend more seamlessly into the watch. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t at least mention the new jet black case color option, as well as the polished titanium models that replace the previous stainless steel ones. They’re nice options to have, if you can afford the $300 upgrade for the new lighter material.</p> 
<p>Finally, part of why the Series 10 got thinner is its redesigned metal back, which allowed Apple to integrate the antenna into the case and compress two layers into one. There’s also a little so-called isolation circle to help maintain cellular performance. This isn’t something you’ll feel necessarily, but it does contribute to the Series 10’s overall thinness.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-apple-watch-series-10s-speaker">The Apple Watch Series 10’s speaker</h2> 
<p>Something Apple brought to the Series 10 is the ability to play music and podcasts through the watch’s onboard speaker. It might seem silly to want to use the tiny device for any sort of media, especially things like songs where you’d like at least <em>some</em> semblance of sound quality for the experience to be enjoyable. In the few days I’ve had the Series 10, I never found the need to stream songs from the speaker on the watch, until I had to test it.</p> 
<p>At the maximum loudness in a quiet conference room, I enjoyed listening to <em>Running Through the Night</em> by Seori and <em>Espresso</em> by Sabrina Carpenter. It wasn’t as bass-heavy as I’d like for a regular listening session, but given the circumstances and the size of the watch, the mids and trebles were plenty clear and punchy. You’re not meant to rely on this for long periods anyway, and it’s just there to scratch an itch if or when it arises. With noisier environments, though, it’s a struggle.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-the-apple-watch-series-10-vs-sleep-apnea">The Apple Watch Series 10 vs. sleep apnea</h2> 
<p>Arguably the biggest feature coming to the Series 10 is sleep apnea monitoring (though that feature is also available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2 via watchOS 11). This is only for people who haven’t been diagnosed with sleep apnea, meaning if you already know you have this condition, it’s not designed to help you see if your CPAP machine is effective, for instance.</p> 
<p>I’ve not been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and might very well be one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.ncoa.org/adviser/sleep/sleep-apnea-statistics/">80 percent of people that has the condition and don’t know it</a>. Still, it would be nice to know for certain and when <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-11-is-out-now-with-new-sleep-apnea-feature-182103629.html">watchOS 11 dropped yesterday</a>, those of us on iOS 18 with compatible Apple Watch models were able to opt in to notifications. I went to the Health app to set this up, answered a series of questions about my age and whether I’d been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and was informed I was set up for the feature.</p> 
<p>In the explanation Apple provides during the onboarding process, it says “Apple Watch tracks your breathing while you’re asleep and records any disturbances in a 30-day period.” It can notify you if those disturbances “are suggestive of sleep apnea,” so you can go to a doctor for a proper diagnosis.</p> 
<p>It’s been only about a week since Apple announced sleep apnea notifications were coming, and clearly 30 days haven’t passed. I have yet to glean enough information for any alerts, and cannot yet gauge the impact of this feature.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-apple-watch-series-10-as-a-health-and-fitness-tracker">The Apple Watch Series 10 as a health and fitness tracker</h2> 
<p>Barring changes that come with watchOS 11, which older Apple Watches will also get, the Series 10 is essentially the same as its predecessor when it comes to tracking your activity. As long as you’ve set things up right, you’ll get reminders to log your mood, take your meds and move after you’ve been idle too long.</p> 
<p>Having just <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-review-google-finally-got-it-right-especially-with-the-battery-life-170005758.html">reviewed Google’s Pixel Watch 3</a>, I can’t help but wish Apple were a tad more sensitive and consistent at automatically prompting me to start logging a walk. There’s no real guidance as to how long you have to have been active for the watch to suggest you’d been working out. That leads to some confusion and pure frustration when you think you’d walked or run enough for the auto detection to kick in, but only to find out you maybe hadn’t moved in the right way or for long enough.</p> 
<p>I’ve been a yearslong Apple Watch user, so I’ve grown extremely familiar and reliant on its interface and the data it collects. I like diving into my calendar view and looking proudly at all the days I closed my rings. The Health app does a good job of presenting my recent trends and how that compares with my performance a year ago, subtly shaming me into realizing I should maybe take a few more walks a week. The Series 10 doesn’t differ much from the Series 9 in that way, and if you’re already in Apple’s ecosystem, this will largely feel extremely familiar.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-the-apple-watch-series-10s-water-sports-features">The Apple Watch Series 10’s water-sports features</h2> 
<p>There are some new tools on the Series 10 that are borrowed from elsewhere in the family, though. Apple’s brought the Watch Ultra’s Depth app over and introduced a new Tides app across the Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 that should be helpful for those who spend a lot of time in the water.</p> 
<p>I’m not a big water sports girl, but I do occasionally hang out at beaches. Whether it’s Long Island’s pristine, sandy shores or the rocky terrain of Red Hook’s Valentino Pier, I’ve certainly encountered sudden swells in water level that I’ve had to run to avoid. It’s not the biggest problem, of course, but I can see how the Tides app would help anyone plan a day. I launched the app, and in a few seconds, the Series 10 located the closest beach, informing me that the tide was falling and that water levels would hit their lowest at about 2:07AM.</p> 
<p>I didn’t verify this by going to Newport Beach at 2:07AM to measure water levels, but even from my brief testing it appears to be a helpful app for those who need to know this information for a full day of surfing, for example. It’s also useful for those who want a convenient way to locate the closest body of water, since the map view shows beaches around you.</p> 
<p>It’s hard to imagine the Depth app being useful for a non-snorkeler or non-scuba diver like me, as I’ve watched one too many videos of underwater cave diving gone wrong. But the Depth app and water temperature sensor could theoretically be useful in other scenarios. If you have a deep enough tub, you could potentially stick the Series 10 on your wrist into the bottom and get a reading for whether the water is too hot for your kid.</p> 
<p>Unlike on the Apple Watch Ultra (1 and 2), which go down to 40 meters (131.2 feet), the Series 10’s depth gauge will only provide readings up to 6 meters. That does mean you won’t want to take this scuba diving, and it’s not rated for that, either. All three models I mentioned here offer the same water temperature capability, though.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-apple-watch-series-10s-battery-life-and-charging-speed">The Apple Watch Series 10’s battery life and charging speed</h2> 
<p>In the few days I’ve had the Apple Watch Series 10, it’s generally outlasted the Series 9, not usually by much. One day, after a cross-training workout at 8AM followed by a GPS-enabled walk and a day full of Slack and Telegram alerts, the Series 10 still managed to have 46 percent left at 11:45PM when I got home. The Series 9 was struggling at 19 percent, and both had the same display and Always On settings. This is one aspect that I’d like more time testing to better understand, but considering the new watch’s slimmer profile and bigger screen, the fact that it even has similar runtime at all would be respectable.</p> 
<p>Apple also updated the charging setup on its latest smartwatch, which should bring the Series 10 back to 80 percent in 30 minutes. It’s worth noting you’ll have to use a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102454">fast-charge-certified accessory</a>, such as a charging cable from the Series 7 or later, which you can tell by confirming that the wire is braided. Faster recharge speeds are nice, since they make up for any shortfalls in battery life by making sure you don’t need to wait too long for your device to get back up to a healthy level.</p> 
<p>Still, considering many devices from Garmin, Fitbit and even Samsung can last longer than two days and even up to seven days per charge, the Apple Watch’s day and a half feels like a number that <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-apple-watch-series-10-deserves-more-than-18-hour-battery-life-170410297.html">could be higher</a>. If the company were looking for ways to push the envelope further, battery life is certainly the area to investigate. I don’t mind charging my watch every morning (or night), but some people want to be able to go camping over a long weekend and not have to worry about bringing along chargers. Don’t tell them to buy an Apple Watch Ultra for that benefit.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>It’s hard to sum up how I feel about the Apple Watch Series 10. On one hand, I definitely still need more time to form a conclusion about things I don’t feel familiar with yet, like sleep apnea alerts. On the other, I feel like I already know this product very well, thanks to its similarity to its predecessor(s). Plus, with watchOS 11 bringing a lot of similar features to the Series 9, Watch Ultra 2 and more, it feels difficult to recommend anyone with a recent device spring for an upgrade. Some of my friends considering the Series 10 are coming from the Series 8 or older, and for them Apple’s latest certainly feels worthwhile.</p> 
<p>However, those using an older model should be aware that upgrading to a newer Apple Watch would cost them access to the blood oxygen detection features. The company has yet to bring back the Blood Oxygen app that it removed from the Series 9 and Ultra 2 that it sells in the US, as a result of a <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/itc-rules-against-apple-in-patent-dispute-setting-up-potential-ban-181123636.html">patent lawsuit filed by Masimo</a>. It’s entirely possible the company is able to revive this feature simply through a software update, but if this measurement is crucial to your daily life, it might be worth sticking with your Series 8.</p> 
<p>Those looking for a huge leap forward because of the number “10” in the device’s name should be prepared to be underwhelmed. But just because the Series 10 isn’t a reinvention of smartwatches doesn’t mean it isn’t still an excellent companion device and well-rounded health-tracker. If you’re simply looking for a new Apple Watch or don’t care for SpO2 readings, and are coming from a model that’s at least two years old, the Series 10 will feel like a solid upgrade. And it’s still the best for any iPhone owner.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After years of scrutiny over its handling of teen safety on its platform, Meta is introducing a new type of account that will soon be required for all teens under 16 on Instagram. The new “teen accounts” add more parental supervision tools and automatically opt teens into stricter privacy settings that can only be adjusted with parental approval.</p>
<p>The changes are unlikely to satisfy Meta’s toughest critics, who have argued that the company puts its own profits ahead of teens’ safety and wellbeing.  But the changes will be significant for the app’s legions of younger users who will face new restrictions on how they use the app.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With teen accounts, kids younger than 16 will be automatically opted into Instagram’s strictest privacy settings. Many of these settings, like automatically private <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html">accounts</a>, the inability <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagram-will-block-dms-to-teens-unless-theyre-from-a-friend-130552718.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagram-will-block-dms-to-teens-unless-theyre-from-a-friend-130552718.html">to message</a> strangers and the limiting of “<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-will-limit-sensitive-content-for-new-teen-users-by-default-185029119.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-will-limit-sensitive-content-for-new-teen-users-by-default-185029119.html">sensitive content</a>” have already been in place for teenagers on Instagram. But younger teens will now be unable to change these settings without approval from a parent.</p>
<p>And, once a parent has set up Instagram’s in-app supervision tools, they’ll be able to monitor which accounts their kids are exchanging messages with (parents won’t see the contents of those DMs, however) as well as the types of topics their children are seeing posts about in their feeds. Parents will also have the ability to limit the amount of time their kids spend in the app by setting up “sleep mode” — which will mute notifications or make the app inaccessible entirely  — or reminders to take breaks.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-09/140bca00-7474-11ef-b5b2-795b3db7966e" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-09/140bca00-7474-11ef-b5b2-795b3db7966e" style="height:1279px;width:1920px;" alt="Parents will be able to see who their children are messaging with and limit their time in the app." data-uuid="f22171ea-fb1c-39f1-9d58-a9d92fa01923"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure>
<p>The changes, according to Meta, are meant to “give parents greater oversight of their teens’ experiences.” While the company has had some parental supervision features <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-will-add-parental-supervision-features-to-instagram-130034971.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/meta-will-add-parental-supervision-features-to-instagram-130034971.html">since 2022,</a> the features were optional and required teens to opt-in to the controls. Teen accounts, on the other hand, will be mandatory for all teens younger than 16 and the more restrictive settings, like the ability to make an account public, aren’t able to be adjusted without parent approval.</p>
<p>The company says it also has a plan to find teens who have already lied about their age when setting up their Instagram account. Beginning next year, the company will use AI to detect signs an account may belong to a teen, like the age of other linked accounts and the ages on the accounts they frequently interact with, to find younger users trying to avoid its new restrictions. The app will then prompt users to verify their age.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Meta will start designating new accounts created by 13 to 15-year-olds as “teen accounts” beginning today. The company will start switching over existing teens into the accounts over the next two months in the US, Canada, UK and Australia, with a wider rollout in the European Union planned for “later this year.” Teen accounts will be available in other countries and on Meta’s other apps beginning in 2025.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-teen-accounts-with-parental-controls-will-be-mandatory-for-kids-under-16-120013852.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple expanded its AirPod family with two new models last week. We’ve now tested out the AirPods 4 — and a second version with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) — and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">we have some thoughts</a>. Improved sound quality and some advanced features are the key additions, but you’re more likely to notice the redesigned shape for keeping the buds more firmly (and comfortably) lodged in ears.</p>
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-09/4f3afb20-74db-11ef-9fd7-ebc2a798ee9a" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-09/4f3afb20-74db-11ef-9fd7-ebc2a798ee9a" style="height:427px;width:640px;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="dabeed21-6e53-31cf-afe1-28c4b296ff8c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a>
<p>With the ANC version, Apple offers useful noise cancellation while keeping your ears open — no silicone tips. There are also a lot of Pro features, but the issue is the more technically capable AirPods Pro are often on sale, undercutting those $179 buds.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have guessed it, but the basic $129 AirPods 4 may be the better deal.</p>

<p>Meta has banned RT and other Russian state media outlets on its platforms, which include Facebook and Instagram. “After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets,” the company told Engadget. “Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity.” This comes days after the Biden–Harris administration <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/meta-bans-rt-russian-disinformation-rcna171402">publicly accused RT</a> of spreading propaganda and disinformation online.</p>

<p><em>The New York Times</em> has brought its all-conquering daily word game to a new platform in the shape of Meta Quest headsets. <em>Wordle VR</em> works in much the same way as the game on your phone or computer, with six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Except you’re wearing a VR headset.</p>

<p>Amazon’s big sale event / buyer’s remorse generator will return this year on October 8 and 9, giving us all the more reason to call it October Prime Day as we have done in years past. Prime Day in July remains Amazon’s biggest sale event for Prime members, but ever since its debut in 2022, October Prime Day provides subscribers with thousands of exclusive deals during the two-day window. In case you missed out on that Echo. Again.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Intel is turning its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, into an independent subsidiary. The company has revealed its plan in a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1710/a-message-from-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-to-employees">note to employees</a> from its CEO Pat Gelsinger, published over a month after Intel disclosed that it&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-will-cut-over-15000-jobs-in-a-sweeping-cost-cutting-effort-220951016.html">cutting 15 percent of its workforce</a>. Intel is laying off more than 15,000 people as part of its $10 billion cost-reduction plan to regain financial stability following a second-quarter net loss of $1.6 billion. Gelsinger explained in his new memo that turning the foundry into a subsidiary &quot;will unlock important benefits,&quot; particularly the ability to evaluate and take external funding directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gelsinger said that there will be no changes to the foundry&#39;s leadership, but the subsidiary will establish its own operating board with independent directors to govern it. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/intel-turns-foundry-business-into-subsidiary-weighs-outside-funding.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, Intel is even considering making the foundry a separate publicly traded company. Intel is in the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/updates-intel-10-largest-construction-projects.html#gs.facp5p">midst of modernizing</a> its existing fabs and building new ones for its foundry business, which is costing the company billions of dollars, in an effort to catch up to its chipmaking rivals like TSMC and Samsung. The company has reportedly spent around $25 billion a year on its foundry business over the past two years, but that has yet to translate into profit.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In April, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-discloses-financials-foundry-business-2024-04-02/">revealed in a presentation</a> to investors that the business posted $7 billion in operating losses for 2023, even larger than the $5.2 billion in losses that it incurred the previous year. It had a revenue of $18.9 billion, down 31 percent from its 2022 revenue of $27.49 billion. Gelsinger warned investors at the time that Intel expects its foundry business&#39; operating loss for 2024 to be even bigger and that it doesn&#39;t expect to break even until 2027. The foundry&#39;s finances aren&#39;t the division&#39;s only problem: Its next-gen manufacturing process referred to as &quot;18A&quot; reportedly <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/intels-next-gen-chip-manufacturing-process-reportedly-hits-snag-after-failing-crucial-tests-172220843.html">failed crucial tests</a> to prove that it&#39;s ready to be used for mass production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to announcing that the foundry business will become a subsidiary, Gelsinger also disclosed in the memo that Intel will be selling part of its stake in Altera, another chipmaker that it <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-29-intel-altera-acquisition-wrapped.html">purchased</a> for $16.7 billion in 2015.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/intel-is-separating-its-ailing-foundry-business-from-the-main-company-110043046.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you're ready to dive into the world of immersive digital experiences, investing in a virtual reality headset is the way to go. Whether you're into gaming, virtual workouts or exploring incredible 360-degree environments, a VR headset can transport you to places you’ve never been – all from the comfort of your own home.<br><br>If you’re still on the fence about whether a VR headset is for you, there are plenty of reasons you might want to explore virtual reality. Maybe you're looking for a more immersive gaming experience, or perhaps you want to use it for fitness, meditation, or even virtual travel. VR headsets can also be great for work, offering virtual meeting rooms and collaborative spaces that go beyond standard video calls.<br><br>Now more than in years past, there’s something for everyone thanks to more VR headsets being on the market at various price ranges. The Meta Quest 3, for example, offers fantastic all-around performance at around $500, while the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">Apple Vision Pro</a> is packed with cutting-edge tech, but it'll set you back a hefty $3,500. We’ve tested and reviewed a number of the most popular VR headsets on the market to help you figure out which are the best for your needs (and budget).</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-vr-headsets">How we test VR headsets</h2> 
<p>I tend to judge VR headsets on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It's not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto it. But it takes skill to craft something that's well balanced and doesn't feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>My test for ergonomics is fairly simple: How long can I wear a headset until I start to feel discomfort? For the most ergonomic devices, like the Quest 3, that could easily be an hour or two. But heavier PC hardware often feels cumbersome after just 15 minutes — you won’t find headsets guilty of that in this guide.</p> 
<p>Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, so everything looks sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a narrow field of view makes it feel like you’re looking through a pair of binoculars, and limits your sense of “presence,” or the idea that you’re actually transported to a virtual world.</p> 
<p>A wide field of view, on the other hand, can make it seem like you’re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth. We look at a few popular games, like <em>Superhot</em>, <em>Beat Saber </em>and <em>Pistol Whip</em>, on every headset to judge how immersed we feel.</p> 
<p>The best controllers fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has basically adopted the design of Meta’s excellent touch controllers, but we're also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve's finger tracking gamepads. We judge controllers based on how easy they are to hold, how they hold up to sweaty gameplay sessions and how easily headsets can track their position in space.</p> 
<p>However, it’s important to look at a virtual reality headset’s specs as a whole. Depending on what you’re looking for from a VR headset, you’ll want to consider factors like your PC’s graphics card if you plan to use the headset to play the best VR games. If you’re not looking to invest in a VR headset solely for gaming, features like head tracking allow you to explore your environment just by simply moving your head in the simulator. This often results in a more immersive and realistic experience.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-meta-quest-pro">Meta Quest Pro</h3> 
<p>As great as the Meta Quest 3 is, the Quest 2 is still a very good entry-level VR headset, and it’s worth considering if it’s on sale below its current $250 list price. The <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313-130045431.html">Meta Quest Pro</a>, on the the hand, is an expensive boondoggle best ignored.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-htc-vive-pro-2">HTC Vive Pro 2</h3> 
<p>Outside of Meta’s hardware, the HTC <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685-133000767.html">Vive Pro 2</a> remains a fantastic PC headset, but it’s far more expensive than the Valve Index, which is more comfortable and offers better audio.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-vr-headset-faqs">VR headset FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-do-vr-headsets-work">How do VR headsets work?</h3> 
<p>At the most basic level, a VR headset is simply a high quality screen that you’re holding up to your face. For a wired headset, the actual work of rendering a game is done on either a PC or game console. For completely wireless devices, like the Meta Quest 3, that work is handled right on the headset. They rely on either external sensors, or sensors built into the headsets, to map your physical space. While you can use a traditional gamepad or keyboard and mouse in VR, they typically use motion tracking controllers to immerse you in their 3D environments.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-vr-headset-is-best-for-full-body-tracking">What VR headset is best for full body tracking?</h3> 
<p>While we’re still waiting for a truly great haptic VR bodysuit to arrive, you can still achieve accurate body tracking with most Steam VR-compatible PC headsets. The Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro 2 both rely on room-tracking sensors that can map your body more effectively than the built-in sensors on competitors. You can also add HTC Vive Trackers to wrist and leg straps, as well as belts, for even better coverage. The Meta Quest 3 doesn’t have any easy body tracking solutions, but you can <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.vr-wave.store/blogs/virtual-reality-prescription-lenses/get-full-body-tracking-on-your-quest-2">add Vive trackers when it’s plugged into your PC</a> to mimic a Steam VR headset.</p> 
<p>Only a few experiences, like VRChat, take advantage of full body tracking at the moment. Currently there aren’t any body tracking solutions for the PlayStation VR and VR2, but we’re intrigued by the company’s <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.vr-wave.store/blogs/virtual-reality-prescription-lenses/get-full-body-tracking-on-your-quest-2">Mocopi body trackers</a>, which were really announced in Japan.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-vr-headsets-are-better-than-oculus">What VR headsets are better than Oculus?</h3> 
<p>Oculus is the previous name for Meta’s VR hardware. Currently, Meta only supports the Quest 3, Quest 2 and Quest Pro, all of which are wireless headsets. As we explain above, PC VR headsets can generally achieve better quality virtual reality, since they rely on more powerful graphics hardware.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-vr-headsets-work-with-xbox">What VR headsets work with Xbox?</h3> 
<p>Currently, Microsoft’s Xbox consoles don’t support any VR headsets.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 2022, Amazon has held a second <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">Prime Day</a> of sorts in October and that sale event is coming back this year, too. Prime Big Deal Days returns on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-dates-announced-the-fall-prime-day-sale-returns-on-october-8-and-9-050356195.html">October 8 and 9</a>, but we’re already starting to see some decent deals pop up across Amazon’s site. As per usual, most of the deals we expected to see on October Prime Day will be exclusively for Prime members — and some of the early Prime Day deals we’re seeing now have followed suit.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a Prime membership, don’t fret too much — there are always a few discounts available for all shoppers. However, if you pay the $139 annual fee for Prime, now’s the time to put it to even better use. These are the best October Prime day tech deals we’ve found ahead of Prime Big Deal Days. We’ll be updating this post regularly in the lead-up to October Prime Day, so check back for the latest deals.</p>

<p>While it'd be wishful thinking to see discounts on the new AirPods or Apple Watch Series 10, there are still some decent Apple deals you can snag right now on iPads and accessories, plus some Beats gear.</p>

<p>It's always a good idea to wait until shopping events like October Prime Day to stock up on charging gear from Anker, or any other company. It's a safe bet that many more Anker devices will go on sale during the days of fall Prime Day, but those in need of an extra power bank or charger immediately can snag a few for less right now.</p>

<p>While these discounts aren't technically October Prime day tech deals, we'd be remiss not to mention them. While sales on streaming services are becoming more common, there isn't as much rhyme or reason to them as there is to, say, Amazon's Prime Day sale cycle. That said, if you see a discount on a service you've been meaning to try, it's worthwhile to jump on it.</p>

Engadget cares most about tech deals, and in past fall Prime Days, we've seen things like phones, tablets, headphones, earbuds, robot vacuums, smart home gear and more receive deep discounts.</p>
<h3 id="jump-link-do-i-need-an-amazon-prime-membership-to-shop-prime-day-deals">Do I need an Amazon Prime membership to shop Prime Day deals?</h3>
<p>Yes, because most deals will be Prime exclusives. However, there are always a few decent deals available to all Amazon shoppers, so it's worth checking out Amazon's site during October Prime Day to see where you can save even if you don't pay for Prime.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-big-deal-days-october-2024">knew</a> Amazon would revive its Prime Big Deal Days sale event this fall, but we didn’t know the exact dates until today. The online retailer <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-announces-prime-big-deal-days-2024-dates">announced</a> that the sale event will return this year on October 8 and 9, giving us all the more reason to call it <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day/">October Prime Day</a> as we have done in years past. This is the third iteration of the fall sale event that Amazon has used as its (un)official kickoff to the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>Prime Day in July remains Amazon’s marquee sale event for Prime members, but ever since its debut in 2022, October Prime Day provides subscribers with thousands of exclusive deals to shop during the two-day window. In turn, it also provides Amazon a way to boost sales during the same time period and, arguably more importantly, increase the number of overall <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2FtYXpvbnByaW1lP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkZjQ5MjZhLThiNDktNGMzZS1hODE3LTJkNzE1ZDA2ZDRlNyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9hbWF6b25wcmltZSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaT0l6l8QZZ1tiOw_G6t9XACS436kH8LDLEx0hF1Za3R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Prime subscribers</a>. While we expect most of the deals during Prime Big Deal Days to be exclusively for Prime members, there are always a few thrown in that are available to all Amazon shoppers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the deals we expect, it’s a safe bet that Amazon’s own devices will be on sale: things like Echo speakers, Kindle ereaders, Blink security cameras and more. We usually see tech like wireless earbuds, speakers, robot vacuums and SSDs go on sale during events like this as well. While it might feel too early to even think about holiday shopping, it’s a good idea to entertain. If history is any indication, the sale prices we see during October Prime Day will be similar (and in some cases, the same) as those we see during <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cyber-monday/">Cyber Monday</a> this year. If you can shop early and cross a few things off your list, we recommend doing so.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of what we could expect to see during October Prime Day this year, these are a few of the <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-50-best-prime-day-deals-to-shop-while-you-still-can-from-portable-tech-to-smart-home-gear-194854033.html">standout deals</a> we saw during the 2023 event:</p>

It said it expects the outlets to continue with their deceptive practices. The ban will be enforced over the coming days.&nbsp;</p>

You can download and install it if your device is compatible, but it already comes with all iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16 Pro models that will be available on September 20. Those with eligible devices can update them by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; About &gt; Software Update </strong>and starting the download and installation processes.</p>
<p>To see if your device is eligible, we have a list of iPhone models that can <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-ios-18-release-date-is-september-16-but-is-your-iphone-compatible-here-are-the-eligible-devices-and-new-features-to-expect-155304853.html">support iOS 18</a>. Check it out and see if yours will work.</p>

Safari is getting a “Highlights” function, which generates a summary of web pages you’re on via machine learning. Our UK bureau chief Mat Smith also tried out some <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-18-preview-waiting-on-apple-intelligence-for-the-true-upgrade-143059859.html">early iOS 18 features in July</a>, and his main takeaway was that Apple Intelligence is the real star.

<p>Besides iOS 18, all of Apple&#39;s other major sibling operating system updates are available as well. That includes iPadOS 18, visionOS 2, macOS Sequoia, tvOS 18 and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-11-is-out-now-with-new-sleep-apnea-feature-182103629.html">watchOS 11</a>, all of which are coming to their respective devices today. Make sure to check if your devices are eligible for the update and that they have enough space. You may have to free up a few gigabytes of storage first.</p>
<p><strong>Update, September 16, 8:17PM ET: </strong>Added more complete list of additional Apple OS updates that are now available, and additional context about Apple Intelligence (some, not all, of the features are arriving beginning in October).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-has-released-ios-18-heres-how-to-update-your-iphone-171444043.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/index/update-on-safety-and-security-practices/" data-original-link="https://openai.com/index/update-on-safety-and-security-practices/">announced</a> significant changes to its safety and security practices, including the establishment of a new independent board oversight committee. This move comes with a notable shift: CEO Sam Altman is no longer part of the safety committee, marking a departure from the previous structure.</p>
<p>The newly formed Safety and Security Committee (SSC) will be chaired by Zico Kolter, Director of the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. Other key members include Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, retired US Army General Paul Nakasone, and Nicole Seligman, former EVP and General Counsel of Sony Corporation.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This new committee replaces the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openais-new-safety-team-is-led-by-board-members-including-ceo-sam-altman-164927745.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/openais-new-safety-team-is-led-by-board-members-including-ceo-sam-altman-164927745.html">previous</a> Safety and Security Committee that was formed in June 2024, which included Altman among its members. The original committee was tasked with making recommendations on critical safety and security decisions for OpenAI projects and operations.</p>
<p>The SSC's responsibilities now extend beyond recommendations. It will have the authority to oversee safety evaluations for major model releases and exercise oversight over model launches. Crucially, the committee will have the power to delay a release until safety concerns are adequately addressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This restructuring follows a period of scrutiny regarding OpenAI's commitment to AI safety. The company has faced criticism in the past for disbanding its Superalignment team and the departures of key safety-focused personnel. The removal of Altman from the safety committee appears to be an attempt to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest in the company's safety oversight.</p>
<p>OpenAI's latest safety initiative also includes plans to enhance security measures, increase transparency about their work, and collaborate with external organizations. The company has already reached agreements with the US and UK AI Safety Institutes to collaborate on researching emerging AI safety risks and standards for trustworthy AI.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon/"><ins>Amazon</ins></a> drivers in New York City have joined the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/teamsters/"><ins>Teamsters</ins></a> union in the hope of obtaining better pay and working conditions. The union says a majority of drivers at each of three delivery service partners (DSPs) working out of a Queens warehouse have signed authorization cards.</p>
<p>According to a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://teamster.org/2024/09/amazon-drivers-in-queens-new-york-join-teamsters-union/"><ins>Teamsters press release</ins></a>, the drivers have been organizing for a year to secure fair pay, consistent schedules, reasonable workloads and proper pay maintained trucks. They <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://abc7ny.com/maspeth-queens-amazon-workers-strike-warehouse-2023/14157899/"><ins>walked off the job last December</ins></a> as part of a nationwide protest against Amazon’s alleged unfair labor practices and union-busting efforts.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At least on paper, joining the union should give the drivers more leverage as they push Amazon for better working conditions. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the company will play ball. The Amazon Labor Union, one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-staten-island-jfk8-warehouse-vote-to-unionize-161459629.html"><ins>first major successful organization efforts</ins></a> within the company in the US, has yet to secure a union contract, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fails-to-overturn-staten-island-warehouse-vote-to-unionize-064010341.html"><ins>two years after forming</ins></a>. The group <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-labor-union-partners-with-international-brotherhood-of-teamsters-in-new-york-140026309.html"><ins>became a Teamsters affiliate this summer</ins></a>.</p>
<p>However, the union has found some success on behalf of Amazon workers. Last month, a regional National Labor Relations Board director <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/24/nx-s1-5088580/amazon-delivery-drivers-nlrb-employees-teamsters"><ins>determined</ins></a> that Amazon is a joint employer of some third-party drivers in Palmdale, California. The Teamsters hope that finding will set a precedent for the rest for DSP drivers elsewhere. The Queens drivers are the first Amazon workers to organize with the Teamsters following that decision.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/hundreds-of-amazon-drivers-in-nyc-join-the-teamsters-union-202758685.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Roku smart TV platform is an accessible way to watch your favorite streaming content in a centralized location – either built-in to TVs, or by adding affordable dongles or set-top boxes to older televisions. One big advantage of the Roku platform is that it's always getting free software updates to keep it current — like the cool new feature that turns your TV into a sort of virtual art museum by <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/rokus-new-feature-will-turn-your-tv-into-a-fancy-art-delivery-system-214841525.html">displaying famous paintings as a screensaver</a>. However, Roku is less adept when it comes to solving one common frustration of the streaming age: The inability to access popular shows, movies and sporting events because of geographic restrictions.</p>
<p>Using a VPN is a common way to tackle this issue, but unlike Fire TV, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-your-apple-tv-113345557.html">Apple TV</a> and other rivals, Roku systems don’t have native VPN support. But that’s not the end of the story: You can still use a VPN to access a wider range of programming via a Roku — you just need to use a workaround. We’ll show you how.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-the-benefits-of-using-a-vpn">The benefits of using a VPN</h2>
<p>When it comes to streaming, a VPN has one main benefit: changing your IP address — the unique number that identifies the general location of the device and network you're using to access the web. A VPN tunnels your connection through its servers to obfuscate your IP, making it seem like you’re watching from elsewhere. As a result, a service like Netflix will see your location as, say, the United Kingdom versus the US. You’ll then have access to a different set of programming. For example, the TV show <em>Friends</em> is available on Max in the US, but it’s only available on Netflix in the UK.</p>
<p>VPNs have several other benefits related to privacy and security. VPN servers have military-grade AES 256-bit encryption, meaning they’re more secure than connecting to the Internet normally. So, since you’re browsing the Internet by tunneling through the VPN, your Internet service provider can’t see all of your browsing destinations (and sell your viewing habits to data brokers).</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-the-easiest-way-to-use-a-vpn-on-roku">The easiest way to use a VPN on Roku</h2>
<p>Although Roku doesn’t natively support VPNs, there are a few workarounds. You can, for instance, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NordVPN;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c52a3d27-2d9a-44d8-8cf2-6f6387b122a0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NordVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmR2cG4uY29tL2Jsb2cvc2V0dXAtdnBuLXJvdXRlci8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNhNTI4OTFjLTgzOTItNDVmZi04MmRkLTUxOTJhNDQwNGE2MCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9ub3JkdnBuLmNvbS9ibG9nL3NldHVwLXZwbi1yb3V0ZXIvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASOzVoUrGIomh8-Oq4fcQ-3ocQxfNoZh_YJMeB8r1Q7i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2Fblog%2Fsetup-vpn-router%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://nordvpn.com/blog/setup-vpn-router/">set up a VPN on your home’s router</a>. That allows you to protect the whole network and every device that connects to it, keeping everyone in your household anonymous online. But it can also cause confusion when you want to access local services — and it requires a very high-level of technical knowledge, and only works with certain routers.</p>
<p>Instead, we recommend a far easier method: connecting a VPN to your Roku via AirPlay or screencast. To do this, subscribe to a VPN and install it on your smartphone or laptop. Then, stream content on that device and AirPlay or screencast it to your Roku TV. The icon to do this should look like a TV with Wi-Fi rays.</p>

<p>We prefer this method because it’s simpler overall. You can access any geo-blocked content on your smartphone or laptop first and then cast it on your smart TV.</p>

<p>While you'll be using a phone or laptop as the ultimate source for your VPN-routed streams, that actually gives you a wider list of services from which to choose. Although each VPN has the same basic functionalities, their price and extra features vary. Before deciding which one is right for your needs and the devices you have, take some time to look at what each one offers and see what other users have to say. Start by checking out our list of <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html">best VPNs</a> — and happy streaming.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mitch Lowe, one of two <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/moviepass-relaunches-nationwide-with-a-new-pricing-model-171626638.html">MoviePass</a> leaders <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/charge-former-moviepass-execs-securities-wire-fraud-103054548.html">indicted by the Justice Department in 2022</a>, has pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges. The former CEO admitted to conspiring to deceive the public and investors about the service’s sustainability. <em>Variety</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/mitch-lowe-moviepass-securities-fraud-guilty-conspiracy-1236146013/" data-original-link="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/mitch-lowe-moviepass-securities-fraud-guilty-conspiracy-1236146013/">reports</a> that the details of Lowe’s plea agreement haven’t been made public.</p>
<p>Prosecutors claim Lowe knew from the start that the company’s $9.95 “unlimited” plan was a short-term gimmick to attract subscribers and inflate stock. He’s also accused of making false statements in press releases, interviews and SEC filings about MoviePass’ long-term viability.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those statements included allegedly lying about the company’s ability to become profitable on subscription fees alone and having tech that could generate revenue from customer data. He also claimed MoviePass was profiting from multiple revenue streams despite not having any income beyond subscriptions.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also accused Lowe and Ted Farnsworth, former CEO of MoviePass’ parent company Helios and Matheson, of preventing subscribers from getting what was promised from the “unlimited” subscription. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/moviepass-settles-with-ftc-122507602.html">settled with the FTC in 2021</a> over allegations that it intentionally invalidated subscriber passwords to freeze their accounts, blocking their ability to get the movie tickets the service promised. MoviePass and its parent company <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-moviepass-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html">declared bankruptcy in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Although no sentencing date has been set, Lowe is free on bond and has a status conference court date scheduled in Miami for March 2025. The 72-year-old former executive faces a maximum of five years in federal prison.</p>
<p>“Mitch is a good man who is looking to move forward with his life,” Lowe’s attorneys, Margot Moss and David Oscar Markus, said in a statement to <em>Variety</em>. “He has accepted responsibility for his actions in this case and will continue to try to make things right.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Farnsworth is still in custody. He was initially freed on a $1 million bond that was revoked in August 2023 after the feds accused him of misusing nearly $300,000 in company funds. Farnsworth's former boyfriend, who he met on an escort site, was paid $147,000, and received a Cadillac worth $144,000; after the pair split up, the feds say he falsely accused his ex of stealing the vehicle.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/former-moviepass-ceo-reportedly-pleads-guilty-to-securities-fraud-201131284.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s Music Haptics feature is now live, as part of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-ios-18-is-available-today-but-your-iphone-may-not-be-compatible-all-the-eligible-devices-and-new-features-coming-155304186.html">official release of iOS 18</a>. This is an accessibility tool that integrates with Apple Music on iPhones. Simply put, it uses the phone’s speaker-based haptics system, which the company refers to as the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-18-ask-a-luddite-whata-s-a-taptic-engine.html">Taptic Engine</a>, to create “taps, textures and refined vibrations to the audio of the song.”</p>
<p>This is quite obviously aimed toward those affected by hearing loss, allowing them to feel the music. It works with Apple Music, but also with <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-classical-is-now-available-globally-082516950.html">Apple Music Classical</a> and Shazam. The company says it’ll also integrate with some third-party apps, so long as the iPhone is connected to Wi-Fi or cellular.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To get started, just head into the Accessibility settings menu and turn on “Music Haptics.” An easily identifiable logo will appear on the Now Playing screen in the Apple Music app when activated. Tapping this logo will pause the feature and tapping it again will turn it back on. Music Haptics is supported globally on iPhone 12 and later, as long as the device is updated to iOS 18.</p>
<p>To commemorate the launch, Apple Music has released a series of playlists that take advantage of the haptic technology. These channels have names like Haptics Beats and Haptics Bass, so they are filled with songs with plenty of opportunity for taps and vibrations.</p>
<div id="5b782076a6a04f179c8725c3a4aa8282"><div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom:100%;"><a href="https://www.threads.net/@_blunderchief/post/C__EiXxRxx0"></a></div></div></div> 

<p>People have already been experimenting with the feature. Some users have suggested that it “sounds like an Atari game” when a phone is placed on a box with Music Haptics turned on. I don’t agree but, well, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.threads.net/@_blunderchief/post/C__EiXxRxx0?xmt=AQGzNSFvQzGPqPKrBiXUBYEkZsXH6ctIHzh-Mky1Li5C_Q">listen for yourself</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-music-brings-its-audio-haptics-feature-to-all-users-as-part-of-ios-18-184753345.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>It seems that <em>The New York Times</em> isn't quite content with players attempting to complete <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wordle/"><em>Wordle</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>4.8 billion times a year on its apps and website.

That's right, <em>Wordle </em>VR<em>&nbsp;</em>is now a thing. There's a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Oculus;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6f7ae225-b81d-43cd-a3c7-b24c85091f6f&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Oculus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9leHBlcmllbmNlcy93b3JkbGUvMjY3MDQ1NjYyOTU4MDEyMjgvP2ludGVybl9zb3VyY2U9YmxvZyZpbnRlcm5fY29udGVudD13b3JkbGUtbmV3LXlvcmstdGltZXMtZ2FtZXMtcHV6emxlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxZDE1YzIzMi00ODczLTRjMjYtOTRhNy1kZDEzYTMyMmU1NWIiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldGEuY29tL2V4cGVyaWVuY2VzL3dvcmRsZS8yNjcwNDU2NjI5NTgwMTIyOC8_aW50ZXJuX3NvdXJjZT1ibG9nJmludGVybl9jb250ZW50PXdvcmRsZS1uZXcteW9yay10aW1lcy1nYW1lcy1wdXp6bGUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc2PNRjMvslAJXbhUJ5Sq5ALe2YZMN53xDtMZ0pil4P9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fexperiences%2Fwordle%2F26704566295801228%2F%3Fintern_source%3Dblog%26intern_content%3Dwordle-new-york-times-games-puzzle" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.meta.com/experiences/wordle/26704566295801228/?intern_source=blog&amp;intern_content=wordle-new-york-times-games-puzzle"><ins>dedicated app</ins></a> for it on Meta Quest 2, 3 and Pro.</p>
<p><em>Wordle </em>VR<em>&nbsp;</em>works in much the same way as the game does on your phone or computer. You have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. The mystery word is the same for all players and the game refreshes at midnight local time. The main difference in VR is that <em>Wordle </em>is played on a floating screen, with yellow and green blocks in the background. I guess those add a little extra visual stimuli.</p>

<p>I can't imagine that anyone will explicitly strap on a Quest headset just for the two minutes or so it takes to play each round of <em>Wordle</em>. But perhaps having the app on their Quest homescreen will remind them to try to keep their streak going before they hop into <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/asgards-wrath-2-is-metas-most-ambitious-vr-game-to-date-172826048.html"><em><ins>Asgard's Wrath 2</ins></em></a> or that cool-looking <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-the-first-big-exclusive-vr-game-for-the-quest-3-154210616.html"><ins>Batman VR game</ins></a>.

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over three months after Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/watchos-11-includes-a-new-vitals-app-to-see-all-your-key-health-metrics-175600647.html">introduced it at WWDC 2024</a>, watchOS 11 is officially here. The 2024 Apple Watch update, which adds the new Vitals app, widget improvements and sleep apnea detection, is now available to install on your smartwatch.</p>
<p>Apple’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-brings-sleep-apnea-detection-to-the-watch-series-10-172316987.html">sleep apnea detection feature</a>, which the company highlighted in its <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-features-a-much-larger-screen-and-a-much-thinner-design-171307821.html">Apple Watch Series 10 reveal</a>, will also work with a couple of year-old models. If you own the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-9-review-freedom-from-touching-your-screen-130009764.html">Apple Watch Series 9</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-2-and-series-9-first-impressions-double-tap-is-accurate-and-tricky-203116431.html">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, you can try the feature before the new model makes it into customers’ hands later this week. Sleep apnea detection will send you an alert if the watch’s sensors detect overnight breathing disturbances. The health feature, similar to one Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on-didnt-fall-far-from-the-apple-tree-130030349.html">included with the Galaxy Watch 7</a> earlier this year, received <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K240929" data-original-link="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K240929">FDA approval</a> last week.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>watchOS 11 also introduces a new Vitals app, further beefing up Apple’s health-tracking features on its wearable. For those who wear their Apple Watch to bed for sleep tracking (and a handy alarm in the morning), Vitals collects your overnight data in one place. The app establishes baselines for your health metrics. It lets you know if any fall outside your typical range, potentially handy for spotting irregularities like oncoming illnesses or tracking the effects of alcohol use.</p>
<p>Similarly, the new Training Load feature measures the intensity of your workouts over time. After establishing an intensity baseline over 28 days, it shows how hard you’re pushing yourself in your workouts — comparing it with your standard averages. At launch, it supports 17 workout types, including walks, runs, cycling, rowing, swings and more. You’ll find your Training Load in the Activity app on your Apple Watch and the Fitness app on your iPhone.</p>

<p>Apple added a long-requested feature this year: the ability to pause and customize Activity ring goals. It hardly makes sense to keep pushing yourself (at your watch’s prodding) if you’re sick or need rest. The wearable now lets you take a break for a day, week, month or more without losing your award streaks. In addition, you can set different Activity ring goals for each day of the week and customize the data you care about most in the <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-18-is-now-available-171444543.html">iOS 18</a> Fitness app.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch’s Smart Stack (the pile of widgets you see when you scroll down from your watch face) now shows widgets automatically based on context. (For example, rain alerts.) In addition, Live Activities, which <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wwdc-2022-new-features-coming-to-i-os-16-new-lockscreen-171715107.html">arrived on the iPhone</a> two years ago, is also coming to the Apple Watch in the new update. You’ll find Live Activities for things like sports scores you track or an arriving Uber in the watchOS 11 Smart Stack.</p>
<p>Check In is a new feature that lets you notify a friend when you reach your destination. You can begin a Check In from the watchOS Messages app by tapping the plus button next to the text field, choosing Check In and entering where you’re going and when you expect to arrive. Similarly, when exercising, you can start a Check In from the workouts app: Swipe right from the workout screen and choose Check In from the controls. You can then pick a contact to share your exercise routine with.</p>
<p>Other features include new pregnancy tracking in the Cycles app and a Double Tap API that lets third-party developers incorporate hands-free controls.</p>
<p>To download watchOS 11, you’ll first need to <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-18-is-now-available-171444543.html">install iOS 18 on your paired iPhone</a>. After that, open the Watch app on your phone, then head to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Software Update</strong>. It should then prompt you to update to the 2024 software.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-11-is-out-now-with-new-sleep-apnea-feature-182103629.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The Bluetooth range has been extended across the full lineup, but the big news here is the SOS alert button. The system will send out a notification and user location to designated emergency contacts when pressing the button three times. This feature is available to anyone with a free Life360 account, but a premium membership will allow users to send notifications to emergency dispatch services.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Tile Mate ($25) is the standard “everything tracker” with a built-in key ring. This makes it a good choice for keys, backpacks, purses and anything else that can accommodate a key ring. The Bluetooth range is around 350 feet and it features an IP68 water resistance rating and a non-replaceable battery that lasts three years. Orders are <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Tile;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a27b27f-6486-47c7-9cdc-0c4040bd9690&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Tile&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aWxlLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9uZXctYXJyaXZhbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg1MjA2ZDgyLWYzMGEtNDQ4OS1hN2UyLTZmOTM3ZmVkYTRmZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlsZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbmV3LWFycml2YWxzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS9RZnPBzID2KwoUBSoP5OiOFIxNXZlGBg83PRShAOa_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fproducts%2Fnew-arrivals" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.tile.com/products/new-arrivals"><ins>open right now</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The Tile Pro ($35) is an amped-up version of the Mate. It looks the same, but it boasts a longer range, up to 500 feet, and a louder ring. The battery is also user-replaceable. This one won’t be available until October.</p>
<p>The Tile Slim ($30) is designed primarily for wallets, luggage and other items with plenty of nooks and crannies. The range maxes out at 350 feet and each tracker includes a non-replaceable battery that lasts three years. The Tile Sticker ($25) is being advertised as the “smallest Bluetooth tracker on the market” and it’s absolutely tiny. It also includes a sticker that adheres to items. This makes it a great choice for TV remotes and headphones. The range maxes out at 250 feet. Both the Slim and Sticker are available to order right now.</p>

<p>There are, as previously mentioned, snazzy new colors to choose from. The Tile Mate and Slim come in six colors, including black, white, blue, pink, green and yellow. The Tile Pro will be available in both black and white, while the Sticker is only available in black.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Tile <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/a-hacker-obtained-tile-customers-personal-information-171632302.html"><ins>experienced a hack</ins></a> a couple of months back in which customer information was accessed. There’s nothing in the promotional materials to indicate that these new trackers have been outfitted with updated security measures to prevent that kind of thing from happening again. We reached out to the company to inquire about potential safety tech and will update this post if we learn anything notable.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/tile-introduces-its-first-new-bluetooth-trackers-in-years-173100389.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prior to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-18-is-now-available-171444543.html">iOS 18&#39;s arrival</a>, Apple released a firmware update for the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">AirPods Pro 2</a> that will deliver new features the company announced <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-update-adds-head-nodding-gesture-to-silently-respond-to-siri-174141928.html">at WWDC in June</a>. Now that the latest version of the mobile OS is available, your iPhone can fully employ the new tools, which include Siri Interactions, Voice Isolation and more. Your AirPods Pro 2 should have already installed the update and be ready to go when you upgrade to iOS 18, so here&#39;s what to expect when you use the new features.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-siri-interactions">Siri Interactions</h2>
<p>Siri Interactions allow you to interact with your phone at times when you can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to speak or reach for your phone. Machine learning on the H2 chip and transformer models on a source device (iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch) can detect when you nod affirmatively or shake your head. This can be used any time Siri asks a yes or no question, like accepting or rejecting calls, responding to or dismissing messages and engaging with or dismissing notifications.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So far, Siri Interactions have worked as described for me. I like that the tech recognizes smaller head movements, so you don&#39;t have to exaggerate them to get the system to respond. I&#39;ve found the feature most helpful for incoming calls and texts, especially when my hands or full or when I&#39;m in a setting where I can&#39;t immediately speak.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-voice-isolation">Voice Isolation</h2>
<p>Voice Isolation is a new feature that taps the AirPods Pro 2 H2 chip and the source device (iPhone, iPad or Mac) for advanced machine learning to enhance how you sound on calls. The tech isolates your voice so it can effectively cancel significant amounts of background noise, and for some distractions, it will eliminate them entirely. During my tests, Voice Isolation totally blocked a noisy fan and running water. It&#39;s truly impressive how the roar that&#39;s otherwise obvious on a call is completely absent when this is enabled. It&#39;s also great that the tool works its magic with minimal impact to overall voice quality.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-09/6be0e290-39fe-11ed-a7b7-d9f37772c112" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-09/6be0e290-39fe-11ed-a7b7-d9f37772c112" style="height:1333px;width:2000px;" alt="AirPods Pro (2022) review" data-uuid="b2ff21c7-5c05-3293-b3ee-6bb52e407323"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure>
<p>The feature is enabled automatically in your microphone settings, where you&#39;ll find options for Automatic, Standard and Voice Isolation. Here, you can activate Voice Isolation while you&#39;re on a call if you don&#39;t want the system to handle things on its own. The tool will also be supported in FaceTime and any third-party apps that use CallKit. Those include WebEx, Zoom, WhatsApp and many more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a reminder, Siri Interactions and Voice Isolation are also available on <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html">the AirPods 4</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-gaming-features-and-personalized-volume">Gaming features and Personalized Volume</h2>
<p>In addition to those two headliners, the update equips the AirPods Pro 2 with &quot;the best wireless audio latency Apple has ever delivered for mobile gaming.&quot; What&#39;s more, gamers can expect improved voice quality, thanks to 16-bit, 48kHz audio when chatting during sessions. Apple says it also improved Personalized Volume on the AirPods Pro 2, but didn&#39;t go into specifics there. Personalized Volume is the tool that adjusts the media levels on your AirPods Pro 2nd based on changes in environmental conditions and your volume preferences. Apple says that the feature learns your listening preferences over time to fine-tune adjustments as they&#39;re needed.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-hearing-aid-and-hearing-test-arent-in-this-update">Hearing Aid and Hearing Test aren&#39;t in this update</h2>
<p>One of the biggest announcements from the iPhone 16 event was Apple&#39;s plan to turn the AirPods Pro 2 into <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-apples-hearing-aid-and-hearing-test-will-work-on-airpods-pro-154814439.html">a set of over-the-counter hearing aids</a> for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. While the company has <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-fda-greenlights-apples-hearing-aid-feature-for-airpods-pro-164912484.html">received FDA approval</a> for the first software-based hearing aid solution that will be available without a prescription, the feature and the accompanying Hearing Test aren&#39;t ready just yet. Apple is planning to release the suite of hearing features as part of an update sometime this fall.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-how-to-download-the-airpods-pro-2-update">How to download the AirPods Pro 2 update</h2>
<p>The AirPods Pro 2 update <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">is available for free</a> over the air from your iPhone. You can check the version number under the AirPods settings when the earbuds are connected to an iOS device. You&#39;ll want to look for 7A294 to be sure you&#39;re running the latest version. If not, you can trigger the update by listening to music for around 30 seconds and then putting the AirPods Pro back in the case. If you notice that the earbuds don&#39;t immediately disconnect on the Bluetooth menu, that means the update is happening, so keep the case closed and near your phone until it completes. AirPods Pro will disconnect when the process is over. You&#39;ll need to make sure your iPhone is <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-18-is-now-available-171444543.html">updated to iOS 18</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-2s-new-features-have-arrived-heres-what-to-expect-172023882.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>The most recent version of the iPad Air is our pick for the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">best iPad for most people</a>. Sure, it's more expensive than the base iPad, but it's much more capable. Other than the screen real estate, the main difference between the two iPad Air sizes is that the 13-inch variant has a brighter display (600 nits vs 500 nits). Although the fully laminated display is an improvement from the previous iPad Air, the refresh rate is 60Hz, so it doesn't look as smooth as the iPad Pro's 120Hz OLED panel.</p> 
<p>It can handle basic tasks like web browsing and video streaming with ease, thanks to its M2 chipset and 8GB of RAM. The hardware can handle more demanding tasks too — it can run high-end games like <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-is-coming-to-select-apple-devices-on-january-30-173544260.html"><em><ins>Death Stranding</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-resident-evil-4-remake-will-hit-iphone-15-pro-ipad-and-mac-on-december-20-172920550.html"><em><ins>Resident Evil 4 </ins></em><ins>remake</ins></a>. The tablet is also compatible with Apple Intelligence, the suite of AI tools that <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac-arrives-in-october-120502268.html"><ins>Apple will start rolling out in October</ins></a>.</p> 
<p>On top of all that, the M2 iPad Air should run for up to 10 hours or so on a single charge. It has a USB-C port for charging and peripherals, while the Touch ID fingerprint scanner is built into the power button.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While it&#39;s unclear if mainstream PC users are actually using Microsoft&#39;s Copilot AI, the company claims that businesses using MS 365 Copilot are seeing plenty of benefits. According to a Microsoft survey, Copilot users at Honeywell save up to 92 minutes per week, while customer service agents at Teladoc are saving up to five hours a week by using the AI tool to draft responses to questions. Now that we&#39;re a year beyond the MS 365 Copilot launch (at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-charge-businesses-30-per-user-for-its-365-ai-copilot-153042654.html">a costly $30 per seat</a>), Microsoft is eager to throw more AI features at corporate drones.</p>
<p>Most intriguingly, Microsoft is upgrading its Business Chat app, which so far has been a way to interact with Copilot&#39;s across your emails, calendar entries and other data, alongside data from your organization. Now it&#39;s getting better collaboration with the addition of Copilot Pages, which will serve as a sort of &quot;multiplayer&quot; way to share AI generated content with your coworkers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p>

<p>&quot;With Pages, all the data in your organization — whether created by humans or AI — is persistent, accessible and valuable,&quot; Microsoft CVP Jared Spataro wrote in a blog post. &quot;Pages takes ephemeral AI-generated content and makes it durable, so you can edit it, add to it, and share it with others... This is an entirely new work pattern — multiplayer, human to AI to human collaboration.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s surprising that it took a year for Microsoft to bring better collaboration to the Business Chat app, as that&#39;s an expected feature of every workplace app these days. Having a place for employees to share their existing Copilot queries simply makes sense: Coworkers may want access to the same information, and it&#39;s also environmentally wasteful to have people running the same Copilot search multiple times. (<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand">Generative AI queries are far more costly for the environment</a> than simple web searches.)</p>
<p>Microsoft says Pages will be available today to MS 365 Copilot users, and it&#39;ll also be coming to free Copilot customers with Microsoft Entra accounts &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>In general, Microsoft says Copilot queries are more than two times faster now compared to launch, because it&#39;s relying on the newer GPT4o model. The company is also upgrading AI capabilities across the suite of MS 365 apps: Excel is getting Python support for more complex queries; PowerPoint&#39;s Narrative builder capability is widely available, allowing you to craft the story of your presentations with AI help; and Teams can now scan across meeting transcripts and their accompanying chats.</p>

<p>The other Office apps aren&#39;t left out either. Outlook will soon let you choose topics, people and keywords to highlight for the &quot;Prioritize my inbox&quot; feature. You&#39;ll also be able to reference meetings and emails directly within Word documents, one OneDrive will let you summarize and compare files without opening them using Copilot.</p>
<p>And if you need even more Copilot AI help, business can also create Copilot Agents directly within Business Chat and SharePoint. They&#39;re like chatbots that can peer within your corporate files, and you can also tag them in comments like a typical cooworker. While we still need to see these Agents in action to determine if they&#39;re actually useful, at the very least, you can feel less guilty about assigning them some menial information processing at the end of the work day.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-365-copilot-users-can-collaborate-with-ai-and-each-other-in-bizchat-pages-150042326.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p><em>Shogun</em>, based on a book of the same name, is a fictional retelling of 17th-century feudal Japan. The show took home the awards for best lead actor and lead actress in a drama series, with Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai becoming the first Japanese recipients in their respective categories. It also won for outstanding drama series, directing and period costumes, among other accolades.</p>

Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Liza Colón-Zayas won for supporting actor and actress in a comedy series, respectively. The Max show <em>Hacks</em> beat out <em>The Bear</em> for outstanding comedy series and lead actress. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-and-max-win-big-at-75th-primetime-emmys-biggest-winners-104409101.html"><em>The Bear</em></a> already won Disney 10 Emmys earlier this year (four coming from the Creative Arts Emmys) as the 75th Emmys were postponed to January 2024 from September 2023 due to last year&#39;s WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A decade ago, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/someone-made-a-flappy-bird-tribute-for-the-playdate-that-lets-you-use-the-crank-to-fly-160647496.html"><em>Flappy Bird</em></a> became a sensation among smartphone users, with many of us spending far too long getting the little yellow guy to climb higher and higher along pipes. But, it didn&#39;t last long, with it soon pulled from app stores. Here at <em>Engadget</em>, we were excited by the news last week that <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/flappy-bird-is-finally-returning-10-years-after-its-demise-142756765.html"><em>Flappy Bird </em>is coming back to our devices</a> in 2025. However, there&#39;s one person who isn&#39;t psyched: <em>Flappy Bird</em>&#39;s creator, Dong Nguyen. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328">He took to X</a> (formerly Twitter) to confirm he isn&#39;t involved in or profiting off the new version. &quot;No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything. I also don&#39;t support crypto,&quot; he stated.</p>
<div id="4c3034035e3548da912edc73c029d0ad"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything. <br>I also don&#39;t support crypto.</p>— Dong Nguyen (@dongatory) <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div> 
<p>The team behind the new <em>Flappy Bird</em> iteration has been open about being a &quot;new team of passionate fans.&quot; Nguyen&#39;s trademark was <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://x.com/SamNChiet/status/1834246569857634352">reportedly considered abandoned</a>, and Gametech Holdings LLC picked it up for free. The new team then got the rights to Flappy Bird from Gametech.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s unlikely Nguyen would have ever revived the game on his own. He released the original game in May 2013 and made about $50,000 a day from advertising when it blew up the following January. However, he took the game down only a month later, <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800">stating</a>, &quot;I cannot take this anymore.&quot; In an interview with <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lananhnguyen/2014/02/11/exclusive-flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-says-app-gone-forever-because-it-was-an-addictive-product/"><em>Forbes</em></a> then, Nguyen explained, &quot;<em>Flappy Bird </em>was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed. But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it&#39;s best to take down <em>Flappy Bird</em>. It&#39;s gone forever.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/flappy-birds-creator-wants-you-to-know-hes-got-nothing-to-do-with-the-new-version-121532179.html?src=rss]]></description>

Apple has given its entry-level AirPods extra power, while also offering an option between those and the most expensive earbuds in its arsenal. However, your AirPods choice may still come down to whether you prefer an open-wear design or a fully-closed fit.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-design">Design</h2> 
<p>A key difference between the AirPods 4 and Apple’s previous model of “regular” AirPods is the shape of the housing that goes into your ears. The company says it analyzed thousands of ear shapes and over 50 million data points generated by 3D modeling to refine the curves on this new set of buds. Specifically, Apple adjusted the edge of the lower counter and narrowed the overall width for a more secure and more comfortable fit for more people. The company also put the H2 chip in the stem, allowing for a more compact design and improving both airflow and acoustics.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The revised shape does indeed lead to a better fit for my ears. The AirPods 4 are more comfortable and stay in place better than their predecessor. I never once felt like they were going to fall out when I was moving around, unless I turned my head completely to the side to lay down. Open-fit earbuds typically don’t feel the most secure in my ears, but these do, and one less worry contributed to a better overall experience wearing them. Of course, the <em>most secure</em> fit remains with the AirPods Pro.</p> 
<p>There’s a force sensor on the stem of the AirPods 4. On both models, you can use that to control music, take calls and summon Siri. Of course, hands-free access to Apple’s assistant is available on both models as well. And on the ANC set, you can long press on the stem to cycle through Noise Control modes (ANC and transparency).</p> 
<p>What you won’t find here are onboard volume controls. On <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">the AirPods Pro 2</a>, you can slide your finger on the stem to adjust the level. That function is absent on the AirPods 4. Apple recommends you ask Siri to change the volume, use your iPhone’s buttons, drag the slider on the Lock Screen player or swipe over to the Control Center. There’s also the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch if you’re on the Now Playing screen. Honestly, it’s all a hassle. Siri is too slow and reaching for something that’s not my earbuds just makes me mad. But, that hassle was there on the AirPods 3, so at least Apple is consistent.</p> 
<p>Looking at the earbuds themselves, you won’t be able to tell the difference between the two versions of the AirPods 4. You can, however, tell them apart by looking at their cases. The ANC model has a speaker in the case to further assist Find My with beeps, so there are visible holes beside the USB-C port. On both AirPods 4, the LED indicator light is now hidden, so you don’t see an extinguished dot when it’s not on. What’s more, Apple removed the back button for pairing and resetting the earbuds. Now, you’ll double tap near the LED to put the AirPods 4 in pairing mode. And you’ll double tap three times (six taps total) to trigger a reset.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-airpods-4-features">AirPods 4 features</h2> 
<p>The H2 chip from the AirPods Pro unlocks several notable advanced features on the AirPods 4. Sure, some of those are only available on the ANC model, but there are plenty of handy features on the $129 option. On that new entry-level set, you’ll get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking – immersive listening that’s tailored to your hearing. The sound features also include 48kHz, “cinema-quality” audio for FaceTime and Adaptive EQ. And for calls, Apple’s newly introduced Voice Isolation will offer some extra help when you’re taking calls in less than ideal settings.</p> 
<p>The last key piece is Siri Interactions, which allow you to accept or reject calls, respond or dismiss messages and engage or dismiss notifications. All of those are done with a nod or a shake of the head, so you’re free to handle those tasks when you’d rather not speak or can’t reach your phone. And like everything else, you can disable them if you’d rather do things the old fashioned way.</p> 
<p>The AirPods 4 with ANC supports all those and then some. For $179, you’ll also get Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, wireless charging and transparency mode. Adaptive Audio comes in handy when you encounter temporary environmental noise, like a coffee grinder or running water, as the tool automatically adjusts sound settings to maintain the overall listening experience. Conversation Awareness lends a hand for quick chats so you don’t have to futz with the earbuds to participate. However, I still wish Apple would fully pause the audio rather than just lowering the volume. I find it distracting, and in some instances I felt I had to talk louder to project over sounds the other person couldn’t hear. (Apologies to my coffee shop barista if I was shouting while I thanked you.)</p> 
<p>I’ll also note that transparency mode and ANC go hand in hand, so it’s not surprising that a feature to listen to ambient sound was omitted on the cheaper AirPods 4. And lastly, that case speaker on the ANC version will come in handy for Find My when you inevitably misplace the set. The ANC AirPods 4 case also only supports proximity view in Find My though, not the Precision Finding that AirPods Pro 2 offers.</p> 
<p>Of course, there are a few more mainstays from the AirPods lineup that return here. Audio Sharing with someone else wearing Apple or Beats earbuds or headphones is a great feature, as is automatic switching between Apple devices when you get a call or start playing music from your MacBook Pro instead of your iPhone. Both of the AirPods 4 are rated IP54 for moderate dust, sweat and water resistance – just like the AirPods Pro 2. And like that pair, that protection goes for both the earbuds and the case.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-sound-quality">Sound quality</h2> 
<p>Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-key-updates-that-make-airpods-4-block-sound-better--and-just-sound-better-160744010.html">equipped the AirPods 4</a> with a newly designed low-distortion 11mm driver and high dynamic range amplifier. The driver is built with a new membrane mesh as well as a new magnet, and overall, it has higher excursion – or distance the cone can travel. Importantly, Apple is able to offer better acoustic performance by directing the driver straight into the ear rather than positioning it off to the side. By doing this, the company has eliminated sound reflections that impacted overall clarity.</p> 
<p>The “richer bass, crisp highs and even more instrument separation” are all claims that hold true when compared to AirPods 3. There’s more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it’s wider and more immersive. The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.</p> 
<p>That promised instrument separation is apparent on Tycho’s synth-laden <em>Infinite Health</em>. Rather than seeming smashed together, the synths are all layered, reproducing the atmospheric soundscape the artist intended. Billy Strings’ <em>Live Vol. 1 </em>isn’t an Atmos album, but the AirPods 4 do an excellent job with the finer details of the live recordings. You get the reverb of the PA system, warmth of the upright bass and the subtle percussion in the bluegrass picking. The acoustic instruments stand on their own, with plenty of character studio tracks don’t offer. And for bass-heavy styles, like Kaytrana’s <em>Timeless, </em>the AirPods 4 have pleasant, thumping low-end that doesn’t overpower. Vocals still cut through the mix, as does the rest of the electronic/hip-hop instrumentation.</p> 
<p>Audio performance is consistent on both sets of AirPods 4. Like I already mentioned, both are equipped with Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and Adaptive EQ. So, in terms of base sound performance, there are no sonic sacrifices between the two.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-anc-performance-on-the-airpods-4">ANC performance on the AirPods 4</h2> 
<p>Active noise cancellation on open-design earbuds is usually minimally effective. It’s very difficult for the technology to provide the kind of relief from distractions you likely crave when your ears aren’t sealed off with an ear tip. Apple isn’t the first company to try this, but I’d argue it is the first to offer a solution that actually makes a difference.</p> 
<p>Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-key-updates-that-make-airpods-4-block-sound-better--and-just-sound-better-160744010.html">employs the H2 chip</a> and the same ultra-low-noise microphones from the AirPods Pro 2 to power the ANC setup on the AirPods 4. The primary goal is to reduce low-frequency noise, which means you’ll notice the most impact on things like airplane cabin hum, HVAC systems and city traffic. The company promises you’ll be able to listen to music and other media at lower volumes on the ANC model without distraction or sacrifices to audio quality, all thanks to this system.</p> 
<p>It’s not the world-blocking magic that <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review-striving-for-perfection-160023581.html">Sony’s WF-1000XM5</a> and other devices that seal off your ears offer, and it’s not nearly as good as the AirPods Pro 2 either. But, for earbuds with an open-wear design, the difference when ANC is enabled is actually noticeable. The AirPods 4 struggle with TV noise and human voices, but they do well with constant, low rumbling distractions. On similar models I’ve tested from other companies, active noise cancellation made little to no difference, and only served to drain the battery faster. If you’re looking for something close to silence, the AirPods 4 won’t give you that. However, the earbuds will deliver a noise reduction that will put a dent in raucous environments, and do so most effectively with low-frequency sounds.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-call-quality">Call quality</h2> 
<p>AirPods are popular options for hands-free calls, so Apple has improved how you sound when taking voice and video calls. Voice Isolation is an H2-powered tool that Apple says “isolates and enhances your voice,” and is a new feature for the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2. Essentially, it removes background noise to keep you sounding your best when you’re in loud environments.</p> 
<p>With compatible AirPods, like the fourth-gen model, Voice Isolation is enabled by default for calls and FaceTime video, but you can turn it off in microphone settings on iOS, iPad and Mac. The feature also works with any third-party apps that use CallKit, like WebEx, Zoom, WhatsApp and more. Like the ANC, this is another impressive feat from Apple. Voice Isolation totally negates raucous fans, running water and other would-be distractions for the person on the other end. I did notice a very slight difference in overall voice quality, but it’s a fair trade-off for sounding like you’re in a silent room when you’re not.</p> 
<p>The AirPods 4 with ANC also have transparency mode, which is helpful for calls. This noise control setting pipes in the most natural ambient sound of any earbuds, just like the AirPods Pro 2.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-airpods-4-battery-life">AirPods 4 battery life</h2> 
<p>Apple says you can expect five hours of battery life on both versions of the AirPods 4. With ANC active on the pricier model, you’ll get one hour less of play time. Both of the AirPods 4 offer five charges in the case, which brings total usable time to 30 hours. Apple explains that all of its stated battery figures are at 50 percent volume with Spatial Audio off. For the ANC version, the company says the estimates also include disabling Conversation Awareness.</p> 
<p>50 percent volume won’t be loud enough for most people on iOS, so I conducted my tests at around 70 percent there. Around 50 percent is good enough on Mac, though. Using a combination of those two settings across the devices, and employing a mix of both ANC and transparency mode while playing spatial audio and regular content, I got four hours out of the noise-canceling AirPods 4 with no problem. I had no issues hitting the stated figure on the non-ANC version either.</p> 
<p>As a reminder, only the ANC version supports wireless charging. While that case will work with Apple Watch chargers, it doesn’t support MagSafe accessories. If you find yourself in a pinch, both sets of AirPods 4 can offer an hour of use in five minutes.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-competition">The competition</h2> 
<p>Apple’s main competition for the AirPods 4 is the company’s other earbuds. The likes of Sony don’t offer the deep iOS and macOS integration, which is a key selling point for any AirPods. That being said, the AirPods Pro 2 is the only other consideration if you’re looking for another flavor of AirPods. The earbuds are two years old at this point, but the company is still adding new features. For example, AirPods Pro 2 is getting Voice Isolation and Siri Interaction today when iOS 18 drops. More importantly, Apple just got <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/the-fda-greenlights-apples-hearing-aid-feature-for-airpods-pro-164912484.html">FDA approval</a> for its <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-apples-hearing-aid-and-hearing-test-will-work-on-airpods-pro-154814439.html">Hearing Aid feature</a> that will arrive alongside a Hearing Test tool this fall. Expanded Hearing Protection items are on the way as well.</p> 
<p>Of course, you’ll get enhanced noise cancellation (with an ear tip seal) on AirPods Pro 2, and a transparency mode that handles your voice better. There’s also two more hours of battery life over the ANC AirPods 4, a MagSafe-compatible case, Find My Precision Finding and, crucially, on-board volume controls. The second-gen AirPods Pro are available for $190 right now, and we’ve seen them dip to $180 over the summer. If you can find them for the same price as the more expensive AirPods 4, you might want to go that route. I don’t expect Apple will have a replacement before September 2025, so you don’t have to worry about them becoming immediately obsolete if there’s another hardware event next month or early next year.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2> 
<p>With the noise-canceling AirPods 4, Apple has bridged the gap between the entry level model and the AirPods Pro. The ANC version gets nearly all of what makes the AirPods Pro 2 so good, except for the most powerful noise cancellation, the upcoming hearing health features and a few other items. However, a $179 set of AirPods isn’t a great deal right now with the AirPods Pro 2 available for nearly the same price if you catch them on sale. The $129 AirPods 4 is a big improvement over the previous version though, and they’re a worthwhile update for fans of the basic, non-ANC formula. The question then becomes if you prefer the open design and can live without the Pro’s extras. Both versions of the AirPods 4 have their merits, but for once, price won’t be a deciding factor when choosing between two Apple products.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5d335eab-48c2-48a2-8ba5-948754644bbd" />This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Salesforce has rolled out some new AI features for its business-focused <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-ai-will-summarize-your-work-chat-starting-this-winter-130046724.html">Slack</a> chat app designed to take over mundane chores like transcription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key new feature is Slack AI huddle notes to &quot;capture key takeaways and action items so users can focus on the work at hand,&quot; the company wrote. This looks like a more powerful version of a previous <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-ai-will-summarize-your-work-chat-starting-this-winter-130046724.html">Slack AI feature</a> that recaps channel highlights and generates summaries for threads in a single click.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When invited to a huddle, Slack AI creates a transcript based on real-time audio and messages shared in the thread. It can also organize notes with citations, action items and files shared into a canvas. All huddle attendees can then view the notes later, even if they weren&#39;t able to attend.</p>
<p>Slack also updated its AI search feature so that it can surface unique results for a user based on files and apps they uploaded in Slack, including canvases, transcripts from clips, documents from connected apps, Google files and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another timesaver is the new AI Workflow Builder that helps automate tasks. For instance, users can enter a prompt like &quot;send a welcome message to teammates that join a channel&quot; and Slack AI and Workflow Builder will will generate that functionality with no programming required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also arriving in the latest update are Slack templates, pre-configured for specific use cases like managing a project, collecting feedback and triaging help requests. The new Slack AI features are now available as a paid add-on for all subscription plans, and Slack templates will roll out in October 2024.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/slack-ai-will-generate-transcripts-and-notes-from-huddles-120026621.html?src=rss]]></description>

No new hardware needed — it’s all in software updates. In the last decade, we’ve seen several companies tackle hearing-aid technology, aided by the boom in wireless tech. Now, arguably the most influential company in consumer tech is trying it. John Falcone outlines why this is a big deal. Or, at least, a very good deal.</p>

<p>The entire Annapurna Interactive team has left the company after its executives walked out, according to a <em>Bloomberg</em> report. Apparently, the video game publisher had been negotiating with Annapurna Pictures to spin off Annapurna Interactive into its own entity. Those talks broke down, so “all 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned,” the team said in a joint statement.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>E-Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips. E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E-Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.<br><br><strong>Editor's note (September 2024):</strong> reMarkable just announced its third-generation E-Ink tablet, the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkables-third-generation-tablet-gets-a-color-display-120059121.html">reMarkable Paper Pro</a>, which is available now starting at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Remarkable;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1f7efcc9-4a08-437e-b0e7-e67043761cab&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Remarkable&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlbWFya2FibGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL3JlbWFya2FibGUtcGFwZXIvcHJvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcmVtYXJrYWJsZS5jb20vc3RvcmUvcmVtYXJrYWJsZS1wYXBlci9wcm8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATu460K4TRxZrGQuBkLllrw59MpjhHknHEM8ksLrl_XP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fremarkable.com%2Fstore%2Fremarkable-paper%2Fpro" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-paper/pro">$579</a>. The new model has a refined design, faster internals and a color screen. We'll update this guide after we've had the chance to put the Paper Pro through its paces.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2> 
<p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The final note is key here. Most E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of color and lower quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p> 
<p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. An e-reader is also worth considering if this is the case for you, but just know that most standard e-readers do not accept stylus input. If you like to make notes in the margins of books, underline and mark up PDFs and the like, an e-reader won’t cut it.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-latency">Latency</h3> 
<p>I discovered four main things that can really make or break your experience with an E Ink tablet during my testing; first is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” so to speak?) and the stylus’ latency. Most had little to no latency, but there were some that were worse than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-reading">Reading</h3> 
<p>The second thing to consider is the reading experience. How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? While you can find E Ink tablets in all different sizes, most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p> 
<p>The supported file types will also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html">Kindle</a> or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. And with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm">bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet supports reading apps like Amazon’s Kindle or the Kobo app, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-search-functionality">Search functionality</h3> 
<p>Third, most E Ink tablets have some search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save on which pages you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-sharing-and-connectivity">Sharing and connectivity</h3> 
<p>The final factor to consider is sharing and connectivity. Yes, we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, but most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You’ll likely want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried were Wi-Fi devices, and some supported cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-other-e-ink-tablets-weve-tested">Other E Ink tablets we've tested</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lenovo-smart-paper">Lenovo Smart Paper</h3> 
<p>Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-review-a-solid-e-ink-tablet-spoiled-by-the-cost-133056534.html">Smart Paper</a>, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-onyx-boox-tab-ultra">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra</h3> 
<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC5ib294LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90YWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7A7EPvy3G8_cwM2BUU4bg4uNsVGQKK3o2yEjUAdhc2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Ftab" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shop.boox.com/products/tab">Boox Tab Ultra</a> has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-tcl-nxtpaper-14-pro">TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro</h3> 
<p>We got to spend some time with <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tcls-nxtpaper-14-pro-is-somewhere-between-a-tablet-and-a-giant-e-reader-190047895.html">TCL’s latest E Ink-like tablet at CES</a>, the NXTPAPER 14 Pro. Using the company’s NXTPAPER 3.0 technology, the device isn’t precisely an E Ink tablet but one that attempts to strike a balance between the displays of ereaders and standard slabs. It focuses on eye comfort by filtering out up to 61 percent of blue light, using a Circularly Polarized Light (CPL) screen and the like. TCL has not revealed pricing for the NXTPAPER 14 Pro, but it did confirm it would arrive in the US in early 2024.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Achieving your fitness goals doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated. Keeping track of your progress will be crucial, but not everyone needs to drop hundreds of dollars on the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">best smartwatches</a> out there. The average affordable tracker might offer just the right tools to help kickstart your health journey, like a heart rate monitor, sleep quality data and so on. And, after testing a number of affordable fitness trackers, I can say with confidence that you might be surprised by how much a $100 (or less) wearable can do — a welcomed treat for those who don’t want to spend a ton of cash on an Apple Watch. Many of these gadgets go well beyond being glorified pedometers, providing in-depth reports on how you're sleeping at night or giving you a breakdown of your heart rate variability during a workout. But given their price, there will be some sacrifices. To help you decide which is right for you, I tested a number of the best cheap fitness trackers available today to find the ones that are worth your money.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-cheap-fitness-tracker">What to look for in a cheap fitness tracker</h2> 
<p>All of the best fitness trackers should have at least three features: a program to track workouts or movement of some sort, the option to monitor and collect sleep data and the ability to measure health metrics like heart rate and blood oxygen levels (though, the readings might not be super accurate). Don’t set your sights too high and expect metrics like blood pressure monitoring; for that, you’d need to invest in a more expensive wearable like a Samsung Galaxy Watch, which will set you back over $400.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<h3 id="jump-link-fitness-features">Fitness features</h3> 
<p>A cheap workout tracker can be great for someone looking to keep tabs on small, achievable goals like 10,000 steps before sundown or 30 minutes of a HIIT workout to get your heart rate peaking. An experienced long-distance runner looking to train for a triathlon might opt for a more expensive device that can measure cadence or ground contact time, and can track more customizable workouts, offer different sports modes or give deeper insights into performance data.</p> 
<p>At the very least, a budget workout tracker should be able to offer fitness tracking features beyond walking and running — otherwise, it would just be a pedometer. The number of activities a device will recognize varies. Some will get funky with it and consider skateboarding a workout, while others won’t be able to track a jumping jack.</p> 
<p>At this price, you can expect a device to measure a mix of cardio, machine workouts and strength training. With each, you might get a numerical or visual breakdown of heart rate activity, overall pace, and calories burned per session. Although some cheap trackers can offer a really good overview of heart rate zone activity during a workout, a more technically advanced device might be able to go a step further and explain what your results mean and coach you on how to keep your heart rate in a specific bracket so that you can burn more fat per workout. I found that the more budget-friendly the device, the more likely it is that a tracker will fall short when it comes to smart counseling or offering predictive insights beyond a given workout. If a budget tracker does happen to offer some semblance of a coaching program, you can expect it to sit behind a paywall.</p> 
<p>Workout tracking and planning your recovery is just as essential to any fitness journey. A sub-$100 device should be able to tell you how long you’ve slept and provide a breakdown of deep, light and REM sleep activity. It's not a guarantee that you will get a sleep “score” or insights on how to get better rest — that data is usually found on more expensive wearables. Also, because these trackers aren’t designed for bedtime specifically — be mindful of comfort. The bands and watch face on a budget fitness tracker may not be ideal for getting some good shut-eye.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-connectivity-and-practicality">Connectivity and practicality</h3> 
<p>Not all activity trackers, budget-friendly or not, are designed to seamlessly integrate with a smartphone. The trackers tested for this roundup can’t directly make calls or send texts to contacts on a paired smartphone. They can, however, display and dismiss incoming calls and notifications via a Bluetooth connection. You can forget about checking your email or paying for a coffee from your wrist using these more affordable devices.</p> 
<p>Most cheap fitness trackers also won't include a built-in GPS. Instead, they usually depend on a paired smartphone to gather location data. The drawback of using a fitness tracker without GPS is that it might not provide as precise for tracking distance or pace. You also can't use a budget tracker to get turn-by-turn directions during a walk or while running errands. For the more outdoorsy consumers, having GPS could be a key safety feature if you want this kind of functionality at your fingertips.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-design">Design</h3> 
<p>You also might find that an inexpensive fitness tracker is harder to navigate than a more advanced smartwatch. Whether it be a screen size issue or simply not having a smart enough interface, don't expect every feature to be one that you can engage with directly on your wrist. Oftentimes, you will need to pull out your smartphone to log information or access more in-depth health data.</p> 
<p>The quality and build of displays and bands will also vary in this category. Don’t expect the highest resolution OLED displays or the fanciest materials in the bands. But you can expect some level of sweat and water resistance.</p>

The 47c can only track walks and runs. It has a dedicated widget, a small logo of a man running, and when you tap it, it begins measuring your pace, heart rate, calories burned and mileage. It does not auto-detect or auto-pause workouts and it doesn't differentiate between a run and walk. Most importantly, this device can’t track any other exercises. It’s basically a glorified pedometer.</p> 
<p>The 47c was also my least favorite to sleep with, mainly because the square watch face is so large and heavy. Even if I did manage to sleep through the night with it on, it only gave me a basic sleep report.</p>

The watch face is impossible to read outdoors and the exercise widget is also very finicky. To start tracking a run, you have to hold down the main button and flip through some pages until you get to a moving person icon. Once there, you have to press the bottom right corner of the bar and hold down and if you press for too long or in the wrong spot, it’ll switch to another page, like a stopwatch. It’s incredibly frustrating.</p> 
<p>Once you start a run though, it will start tracking your steps, your distance — and that's pretty much it. It does not auto-detect or auto-pause workouts. It doesn't alert you of any mileage or calorie milestones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-cheap-fitness-trackers-140054780.html?src=rss]]></description>

That doesn’t necessarily mean we won’t see it at some point, though. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-15/apple-s-hearing-aid-sleep-apnea-saved-iphone-16-event-m4-mac-launch-details-m13kkabb?cmpid=BBD091524_POWERON" data-original-link="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-15/apple-s-hearing-aid-sleep-apnea-saved-iphone-16-event-m4-mac-launch-details-m13kkabb?cmpid=BBD091524_POWERON">Mark Gurman</a>, who first reported that the company was developing an even cheaper version of the budget watch, the plastic SE “is still moving forward.” Sources told Gurman it could arrive next year.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch SE last got a refresh in 2022 with the release of the second generation line. In addition to a plastic shell, plans for the rumored upcoming watch include bolder colors that would appeal to kids, Gurman reported. But, Apple has apparently hit a manufacturing snag with the plastic design. Last Monday’s official Apple Watch news focused on the Series 10, which has a thinner build and larger display, as was expected in the leadup to the event. In <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-hands-on-bigger-lighter-and-thinner-than-ever-190000233.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-hands-on-bigger-lighter-and-thinner-than-ever-190000233.html"><ins>a hands-on with the new wearable</ins></a>, Engadget’s Billy Steele called the Series 10’s brighter, wide-angle OLED display “a massive upgrade” compared to other recent models.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every couple of years, a core childhood memory resurfaces and sends me hunting for a bizarre PlayStation game my brother and I obsessed over but never actually played in its entirety. The internet search goes like this: <em>game on red-and-black PS1 demo disk featuring  feral child with pink hair tackling pigs and trees that look like butts. </em>The results tell me the game I’m looking for is the 1997 platformer <em>Tomba!</em>, and I giddily bask in the nostalgia. Then I forget all about it, and the cycle eventually repeats.</p>
<p>You can imagine my surprise, then, when a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfYtEggYPI0">trailer</a> popped up earlier this summer announcing Limited Run Games’ rerelease of <em>Tomba!</em> in all its wacky glory for modern consoles. <em>Tomba! Special Edition</em> is now available digitally for PS5, Nintendo Switch and PC. Physical editions, a line of plushies and a themed NEO S controller (pre-orders for which are sadly sold out) are also on the way. And in finally playing it all the way through almost 20 years after its original release, I’ve discovered that <em>Tomba!</em> is even more unhinged than I remembered.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6757045f585b4173a1429cba9503f1b4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfYtEggYPI0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>Tomba, the player-character, is a wild boy who lives outside of society, hunting boars and sleeping under the stars. His peace is disrupted one day when a group of delinquent pigs swoops in and wreaks havoc, ultimately robbing him of a gold bracelet that belonged to his grandfather. To get it back, Tomba ventures into the nearby towns to find the Evil Pig ringleaders and take them down. Along the way, he meets a slew of strange characters who will help guide him on his mission, but only after he completes a bunch of tasks for them.</p>
<p>It’s a 2.5D platformer, meaning much of the game operates like a two-dimensional side-scroller, but you can occasionally move into the background or foreground to explore the map in more depth. <em>Tomba! Special Edition</em> doesn’t change much about the original game. The graphics are still distinctly PS1 polygonal, and the controls can feel clunky. There are some quality of life additions, though — namely a rewind feature that ends up being extremely handy because, as it turns out, this game is pretty tricky in some spots. I found myself needing to try certain maneuvers over and over again to get them right.</p>
<p>Just about every part of the story and its environment carries a touch of absurdity. Tomba is able to scale walls, swing on branches, jump with inhuman ability and apparently store items (including living creatures) in his stomach, which he can regurgitate when they’re needed later on. There are the butt trees, as mentioned earlier, which are allegedly meant to depict <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://tomba.fandom.com/wiki/Peach_Flower_Gas">peaches</a> but when Tomba jumps onto them and squeezes, a cloud of magical gas comes pouring out. You’ll encounter a village of dwarves, but can only communicate with them after leaping on the heads of several dwarves to learn their language. In another village, everyone’s been turned into mice, and for some reason, they’re all wound up about the disappearance of an actual, never-been-human baby mouse.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable areas is undoubtedly the Mushroom Forest, a bad trip of a location that’s filled with creepy, clownish anthropomorphic flowers and mushrooms that inflict Tomba with certain ailments if he jumps onto them. One will have him laughing uncontrollably, while the other makes him wail — and that cry is deeply unsettling. It kind of jump-scared me the first time it happened, if I’m being real. With both mushroom illnesses, Tomba becomes unable to wield his weapons, instead flailing his arms and screaming if you try to do an attack.</p>
<p>It is altogether a surprisingly complex game, and visually striking thanks to its loud color palette. But the quest can feel convoluted as you try to navigate the often confusing map layout and fulfill the many, many tasks thrown your way. Boss fights are uniquely frustrating, too. Instead of simply beating up or killing the Evil Pigs, you have to wrangle each one and throw it in a bag… but the bag is floating and, in most cases, spinning.</p>
<p>While frequently maddening, <em>Tomba!</em> was a joy to revisit. It’s consistently silly, and the soundtrack gave me a welcome blast of nostalgia from the moment its steel drums started playing. (<em>Tomba! Special Edition </em>includes both the original soundtrack and a remastered version, and they’re both great.) If anything, the <em>Special Edition</em> release has made it clear why <em>Tomba! </em>has lingered so long in my memory — I can’t say I’ve ever played another game quite like it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ps1-gem-tomba-is-still-a-wild-ride-nearly-20-years-later-163011449.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>On Thursday, Isaacman and Gillis completed the first commercial spacewalk, each taking a turn to exit the craft and perform a series of spacesuit mobility tests. And with this mission, Gillis and Menon have now traveled farther from Earth than any women before. Polaris reached a peak altitude of about 870 miles, which is also the farthest any humans have ventured since the Apollo program.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The crew also performed a number of science experiments, and was able to complete a 40-minute video call to Earth and send files in a major test for Starlink’s space communications capabilities. That included a video recorded during the mission of Gillis, an engineer and violinist, playing the violin in space. “A new era of commercial spaceflight dawns, with much more to come,” <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/PolarisProgram/status/1835252491480428851">Polaris</a> posted on X Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Could Apple really be teeing up a change that could save my elderly mother more than $1,500? That’s the promise of the company’s newly announced initiative to add true <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-airpods-pro-update-turns-them-into-a-clinical-grade-hearing-aid-174919818.html">hearing aid functionality to the AirPods Pro</a> — and why, with all due respect to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/iphone-16-vs-iphone-16-pro-specs-and-features-compared-side-by-side-182312186.html">iPhone 16</a> and its fancy Camera Control button, it was the most promising section of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/everything-apple-revealed-at-the-iphone-16-launch-event-apple-watch-series-10-airpods-4-ios-18-and-more-170346723.html">Monday’s keynote</a>, to my eyes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The news couldn’t have come at a better time for me. My 80-year-old mother has finally admitted that her hearing is, shall we say, subpar. And she just asked me to book her an appointment at the Miracle Ear clinic down the street (“They’re having a fall sale!”). But before I went down that road, I decided to do some research.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-the-frustrating-world-of-hearing-aids">The frustrating world of hearing aids</h2> 
<p>I knew that there was a burgeoning market for <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/these-are-the-7-best-otc-hearing-aids-according-to-audiologists-and-testers-143635938.html">hearing aids</a> since the US government opened the field to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/over-the-counter-hearing-aids-go-on-sale-in-the-us-174612301.html">over-the-counter competition in 2022</a>. But a bit of googling confirmed that those models — even those with familiar names, like Jabra, Sony and Sennheiser — start at $300 and go north from there, sometimes topping $2,000. And while that’s certainly a lot, the crazy thing is that it’s downright cheap compared to clinical hearing aids. Those often start at $1,000, and can go as high as $5,000 or more. Yes, really.</p> 
<p>Some medical insurance may defer costs, but <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hearing-aids">Medicare doesn’t</a>. While retired military personnel can <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.prosthetics.va.gov/psas/hearing_aids.asp">get hearing aids through the VA</a>, I remember my father’s journey down that path meant that his hearing aids arrived many months after the initial hearing exam.</p>

<p>And here’s the clincher: Many elderly folks seem to loathe their hearing aids, and for good reason: They’re generally tedious and unintuitive to use, sometimes with a single microscopic button to control volume. Want to turn them off? Pop open the battery cover, for starters. (And many hearing aids still use disposable microbatteries.) Case in point: My mother got one of these expensive pair of hearing aids years ago, but found the challenge of wearing and maintaining them wasn’t worth the so-so audio improvement they offered. They still power on, but they don’t seem to work effectively any more — and being out of warranty, the cause of our current hearing aid search.</p> 
<p>The competition from the OTC market has helped in that regard, as the Jabras and Sennheisers of the world push the traditional hearing aid providers to become a bit more tech-savvy. Some eschew the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAASTjKNXBcvucNg5dbCVI3dj2zIPV_tF2J9o48ilft31p&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLexie-Self-Fitting-Bluetooth-Directional-Smartphone%2Fdp%2FB09K1B13TF" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Lexie-Self-Fitting-Bluetooth-Directional-Smartphone/dp/B09K1B13TF">behind-the-ear battery pack</a> and go for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuZWFyZ28uY29tL2VhcmdvLTciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk0Njk2NDNiLTNmNTctNDMzNS04OWQwLWI4ZWNiZGIxNmJjZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zaG9wLmVhcmdvLmNvbS9lYXJnby03In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUCuDgzqBcFt6PS6sOkfiKIywVe0xPSDsELuoQFlqI2o&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.eargo.com%2Feargo-7" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://shop.eargo.com/eargo-7">earbud-style simplicity</a>. Bluetooth connectivity for calls and apps for sound adjustments are finally more common, as older people become accustomed to using their phones and tablets.</p> 
<p>But why go for what’s essentially an AirPods knockoff when you can get the real thing at a fraction of the price? (And — amazingly, in an age where everything has gone the subscription route — free of any sort of recurring monthly fees.)</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-waiting-for-the-software-update--and-managing-expectations">Waiting for the software update — and managing expectations</h2> 
<p>So, when will the hearing aid features become available? What seemed to be weeks away may now be much closer. FDA regulatory signoff (in the US) is already a done deal, arriving just a few days after the initial announcement. That leaves the requisite software upgrade. You’ll need an AirPods Pro paired with a compatible device running iOS 18, or the equivalent 2024 OS updates for iPad or Mac. On the iPhone side, that’s pretty much <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-ios-18-release-date-is-september-16-but-is-your-iphone-compatible-here-are-the-eligible-devices-and-new-features-to-expect-155304853.html">every model sold after the 2018 model year</a> (iPhone XS/XR and later). While those initial software updates hit on September 16, it’s unclear if the hearing aid functionality will arrive then, or sometime later — perhaps alongside the first Apple Intelligence coming in October. (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:;cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vYWlycG9kcy1wcm8vaGVhcmluZy1oZWFsdGgvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NDY5NjQzYi0zZjU3LTQzMzUtODlkMC1iOGVjYmRiMTZiY2YiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9haXJwb2RzLXByby9oZWFyaW5nLWhlYWx0aC8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARWWX-XiqvxNoZlZHtsymADsQXGKe8ikTazJKaItrUcc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fairpods-pro%2Fhearing-health%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/hearing-health/">Apple’s site</a> simply says “coming this fall.”)</p> 
<p>In the meantime, I’ve started the upsell to my mother. I showed her the relevant portion of Apple’s video presentation, and I had her try out my AirPods Pro, just to gauge fit and comfort. The initial response wasn’t enthusiastic. While she liked that they “didn’t fall out of my ears” like the AirPods 2, she’s put off by the penetration of the eartips into her ear canal. Countless other headphone fans agree, and that’s why the design of the new <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-4-have-a-new-design-and-an-anc-upgrade-option-173900817.html">AirPods 4</a> is more open. But Apple hasn’t suggested the hearing aid functionality is coming to those headphones anytime soon — if ever.</p>

<p>And let’s be honest: This isn’t envisioned as a miracle cure. Apple specifically says this feature is “intended for people with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss.” I wouldn’t be surprised if my mother has graduated to the need for pro-level hearing assistance at this point, over-the-counter or otherwise. So we may end up opting for one of those <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWJyYWVuaGFuY2UuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3QiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk0Njk2NDNiLTNmNTctNDMzNS04OWQwLWI4ZWNiZGIxNmJjZiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuamFicmFlbmhhbmNlLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAddAknyyAmoyYEJCZ7-8O36n6dLDKANzCUwBUEUEJDzk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jabraenhance.com%2Fproduct" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.jabraenhance.com/product">Jabra Enhance models</a>, which offer a 100-day no-hassle return policy.</p> 
<p>But now we have the AirPods Pro as a testable alternative. Going forward, anyone in the market for hearing aids can start their journey with the AirPods Pro and its companion free audio test. If you like the results, you’re done — or you at least have a stopgap solution. And if not, you can compare and contrast them against pricier OTC or clinical options in terms of comfort, battery life, ease of use and — of course — the respective efficacy of their actual hearing assistance. The very fact that Apple is in the hearing aid conversation with a $200-ish option feels like a win.</p>

It’ll also work with the original GameCube, but for that, you’ll have to buy the $26 <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/mod-kit-for-original-ngc?variant=44610072412337"><ins>Retro Receiver</ins></a> too. The mod kit comes with Hall Effect joysticks, a trigger pack and a rechargeable 300mAh battery, which 8BitDo says should get you around 6 hours of play time. Pre-orders for the kit are now open, and it’ll ship September 25.</p>

<p>There are numerous adapters on the market that will allow you to use an original wired GameCube controller with the Switch, including 8BitDo’s own <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.8bitdo.com/gbros/"><ins>GBros.</ins></a> adapter and an official one from Nintendo, but the mod kit cuts out the middleman to bring completely wireless Bluetooth connectivity. All you’d need to do is open up the controller and swap the old PCB with the new one.</p>

<p>Anyone who lives with a difficult-to-diagnose chronic illness and has endured the demoralizing process of trying to get proper treatment can tell you it is, at times, a living nightmare. Advocating for yourself, fighting to be taken seriously; it’s something I’ve dealt with most of my life as a person with autoimmune diseases. So when I read the description of Hildur Knútsdóttir’s psychological horror novel, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL05pZ2h0LUd1ZXN0LUhpbGR1ci1LbnV0c2RvdHRpci9kcC8xMjUwMzIyMDQ5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA3ZGJiYjYzLTQzZDEtNDhjZC1hNGIzLTUyOTgxYTA1ZmZmOCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaWdodC1HdWVzdC1IaWxkdXItS251dHNkb3R0aXIvZHAvMTI1MDMyMjA0OSIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQQ2me5CJrO7XAgNU3IYXx1AG350nd8efVATgfJI7wZD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNight-Guest-Hildur-Knutsdottir%2Fdp%2F1250322049" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/Night-Guest-Hildur-Knutsdottir/dp/1250322049"><em>The Night Guest</em></a>, it resonated with me immediately:</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Iðunn is in yet another doctor's office. She knows her constant fatigue is a sign that something's not right, but practitioners dismiss her symptoms and blood tests haven't revealed any cause. When she talks to friends and family about it, the refrain is the same ― have you tried eating better? exercising more? establishing a nighttime routine? She tries to follow their advice, buying everything from vitamins to sleeping pills to a step-counting watch. Nothing helps. Until one night Iðunn falls asleep with the watch on, and wakes up to find she’s walked over 40,000 steps in the night . . . What is happening when she’s asleep?</p></blockquote>
<p><em>The Night Guest </em>is a short, compelling read that puts an unsettling spin on an issue that a lot of people — especially women — can relate to. I pretty much inhaled it.</p>

<p>The origin of life and the question of whether it exists elsewhere is a topic I find to be endlessly interesting (as evidenced by how regularly books about it land among these recommendations).

The Quest for Cosmic Life</em></a>, astrophysicist Mario Livio and Nobel Prize winning biologist Jack Szostak examine what we know about the things that make life possible — the building blocks of life  — and explore how they could have emerged on Earth and, hypothetically, elsewhere. At the heart of the mystery is the as yet unanswered question of whether or not life came to be as the result of a freak accident.</p>
<p>As the authors write in their introduction, “Even with the enormous scientific progress we have witnessed in the past few decades, we still don’t know whether life is an extremely rare chemical accident, in which case we may be alone in our galaxy, or a chemical inevitability, which would potentially make us part of a huge galactic ensemble.”</p>

The planet has been devastated by natural disasters and species have died off in the masses. Looking for anything that can help improve the world’s situation, a team of climate scientists with the Scientific Institute for Nascent Ecology and Worlds (SINEW) ventures out to explore what appears to be an entirely new environment that has popped up out of nowhere near their camp in the Australian outback. But they’re not prepared for what they find.</p>
<p><em>Into the Unbeing</em> is a new gripping science-fiction series that weaves in cosmic horror. The first issue came out at the beginning of the summer, and Part One just wrapped up this week with issue number four. If you were into <em>Scavengers Reign </em>or <em>The Southern Reach Trilogy, </em>you’ll probably enjoy <em>Into the Unbeing. </em>The art alone will suck you right in.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/what-to-read-this-weekend-the-night-guest-is-earth-exceptional-and-into-the-unbeing-194524310.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>23andMe is close to settling a proposed class action lawsuit filed against the company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/23andmes-data-hack-went-unnoticed-for-months-081332978.html">over a data breach</a> that compromised 6.9 million users&#39; information. According to the preliminary settlement filing, the DNA testing company has agreed to pay $30 million to affected customers, as well as to conduct annual computer scans and cybersecurity audits for three years. A website will be built to notify people eligible to a portion of the settlement fund and to facilitate payments. Affected users will also be sent a link where they can delete all their information from the service, and they&#39;ll be able to enroll to a three-year Privacy &amp; Medical Shield + Genetic Monitoring program for free. A judge still has to approve those terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2023, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/23andmes-data-hack-went-unnoticed-for-months-081332978.html">admitted</a> that the DNA Relatives profile information of roughly 5.5 million customers and the Family Tree profile information of 1.4 million DNA Relative participants had been leaked. It later revealed in a legal filing that the bad actors started breaking into customer accounts in late April 2023 and that they had access to its systems until September that year. It said that the hackers used a technique called credential stuffing, which uses previously compromised login credentials to access customer accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The breach led to several class action lawsuits filed against the company, including one that accused 23andMe of failing to notify the plaintiffs that they were <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lawsuit-says-23andme-hackers-targeted-users-with-chinese-and-ashkenazi-jewish-heritage-132423486.html">specifically targeted</a> for having Chinese and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. In the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.428003/gov.uscourts.cand.428003.103.2.pdf">settlement agreement</a> [PDF] for the consolidated lawsuit, 23andMe noted that it &quot;denies the claims and allegations set forth in the Complaint&quot; and that it &quot;denies that it failed to properly protect the Personal Information of its consumers and users.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/23andme-settles-data-breach-lawsuit-30-million-2024-09-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, 23andMe describes its financial condition as &quot;extremely uncertain.&quot; In its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-fiscal-2024">financial report</a> for the 2024 fiscal year, it revealed that it earned a total revenue of $220 million, down 27 percent from a $299 million revenue the year before. A huge chunk of the settlement money will come from cyber insurance, though, which the company expects to cover $25 million out of the $30 million total.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/23andme-will-pay-30-million-to-settle-2023-data-breach-lawsuit-150058702.html?src=rss]]></description>

The Walt Disney Company and DirecTV released a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.directv.com/insider/disney-resolution/" data-original-link="https://www.directv.com/insider/disney-resolution/"><ins>joint statement</ins></a> on Saturday announcing that they are in the process of finalizing a new contract, and that all channels affected by their dispute have been restored. That includes ABC, Freeform, FX and National Geographic channels. Disney <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-directv-customers-access-to-abc-espn-and-more-123047594.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-directv-customers-access-to-abc-espn-and-more-123047594.html"><ins>yanked its networks off DirecTV</ins></a> at the beginning of September after the two companies failed to reach an agreement before their old contract expired. Inconveniently for sports fans, the blackout coincided with the start of football season.</p>
<p>The new multi-year contract brings Disney’s full linear suite of networks back to DirecTV, with package options for genre-focused channel bundles (sports, family, etc) and Disney’s streaming services — Disney+, Hulu an ESPN+. ESPN’s upcoming direct-to-consumer service, which is <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/espn-will-launch-its-flagship-direct-to-consumer-service-in-fall-2025.html" data-original-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/espn-will-launch-its-flagship-direct-to-consumer-service-in-fall-2025.html"><ins>expected to launch this fall</ins></a>, will be included for free. In their statement, Disney and DirecTV said the new deal will give customers “the ability to tailor their video experience through more flexible options.” They also added, “We’d like to thank all affected viewers for their patience and are pleased to restore Disney’s entire portfolio of networks in time for college football and the Emmy Awards this weekend.”</p>

<p>Hardware season is in full swing. Apple launched <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-hands-on-more-pro-than-i-expected-222843896.html">the iPhone 16</a>, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-hands-on-seriously-impressive-anc-performance-211526269.html">AirPods 4</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-hands-on-bigger-lighter-and-thinner-than-ever-190000233.html">Apple Watch Series 10</a> on Monday this week. On the same day, at the very same time, the review embargo for the Pixel Watch 3 lifted, and we managed to get most of our piece up then. Not only that, we also saw Sony announce the PlayStation 5 Pro this week, plus in the last two weeks there has been plenty of news out of the IFA conference in Berlin.

<p>Since our foldables expert Sam Rutherford is on parental leave, the task of <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixel-9-pro-fold-review-a-grown-up-glowed-up-foldable-170043123.html">reviewing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> became mine. But Sam, being the responsible and helpful reviewer that he is, took time out to share his thoughts and impressions with me. He even took the review photos for our piece, and I especially appreciate his using mahjong tiles as an interesting backdrop for his pictures. While I focused my testing on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as a viable smartphone alternative and its use as a multimedia consumption device, Sam provided his insight by comparing Google's foldable to Samsung's <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-the-king-but-for-how-much-longer-140129812.html">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our review brings together those two perspectives, making for a fairly comprehensive analysis, if I do say so myself. We've got camera comparisons between Google and Samsung's offerings, with evaluation of both their software, battery performance, build, shape and more.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was also able to shoot a video encompassing all our reviews of the Pixel 9 family of phones, which covers the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL as well as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The footage goes into some extra detail around things like the Add Me and Made You Look camera updates, as well as what Emergency SOS via Satellite looks like on a Pixel phone.

<p>Google didn't make our lives very easy with its Monday embargo on September 9th, especially with Apple's iPhone 16 launch event happening the same day. But the good news is, our review units had arrived about two weeks prior, so we had enough time with the <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-review-google-finally-got-it-right-especially-with-the-battery-life-170005758.html">Pixel Watch 3</a> to get a better sense for it in the real world. I spent my time with the smaller 41mm model while Sam was able to share some testing insight of the new larger 45mm variant.</p> 
<p>Within a couple of days, Sam and I were trading notes about how impressed we were with the Pixel Watch 3's battery life. Since I hate wearing watches to sleep, Sam graciously filled me in on the watch's sleep-tracking and auto bedtime features. Once again, teamwork made the dream work here (quite literally for me, as I would not have been able to fall asleep otherwise).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On my end, I focused on workouts and activity-tracking, double-wristing the Pixel Watch 3 with my Apple Watch Series 9 everywhere I went for two weeks. I was stoked that the Google smartwatch was better at automatically detecting my every walk, run and bike ride, but found it a little too thick compared to the competition. I also enjoyed the new customizable run workouts that let me set sprint and rest segments during my treadmill sessions.</p> 
<p>I know that a day and a half sounds just about average in terms of battery life for modern smartwatches, but considering older models could barely last 24 hours, the improvements to runtime feel huge. Together with some Google and Pixel integrations, the Pixel Watch 3 finally feels like it's ready to take on the likes of Samsung and Apple's flagship wearables.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-ultimate-ears-everboom-a-floatable-speaker-thats-more-loud-than-good">Ultimate Ears Everboom: A floatable speaker that's more loud than good</h2>

<p>In this review, Billy once again shows us what to look for when getting gear for a party outside. Judging by the beautiful pictures accompanying his review, it's clear that when he's not testing headphones or grilling meats in his backyard, Mr. Grilly Steele spends ample time at the beach for (work-sanctioned) speaker testing. I support it.</p> 
<p>With the <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/ultimate-ears-everboom-review-a-floatable-outdoor-speaker-that-packs-a-punch-161532961.html">UE Everboom</a>, Billy makes clear that the sound quality isn't stellar, and music lacks in the mid range. But if it's volume that you want, the Everboom delivers, beaming sound out in 360 degrees. Plus, it does so in a rugged, waterproof body that can also survive a toss into the pool, since, like the company's other speakers, it floats!</p> 
<p>However, with a score of just 75, the Everboom didn't quite make the cut to be one of the products we award the Recommended title. You'll likely find a better device for your needs from competing brands like Marshall and Beats.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-we-didnt-review-oneplus-pad-2">We didn't review: OnePlus Pad 2</h2> 
<p>With everything that's been happening in the industry and in our own lives lately, we have yet to review the OnePlus Pad 2. Or the <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/motorolas-2024-razr-and-razr-might-be-the-most-stylish-and-affordable-foldables-of-the-year-160024366.html">2024 Moto Razrs</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on-didnt-fall-far-from-the-apple-tree-130030349.html">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, either, for that matter. We continue to test our review units so that experience can inform our evaluation of other products we write up. But time is a resource we never have enough of, and with companies constantly launching new products, it's hard to keep up.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our lead tablet reviewer (and deputy editor) Nathan Ingraham has been spending time with the OnePlus Pad 2, and he does have some thoughts to share. He's a fan of its build and display, finding it light and well-balanced despite being fairly large with a 12.1-inch screen. Speaking of, he also likes the display, appreciating its 301ppi pixel density. In fact, he called this "one of the nicest tablet screens I've seen outside of the iPad."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'll have to get Nate to look at a Samsung Galaxy Tab with a nice AMOLED panel before we make that official, but there are other things that set the OnePlus Pad 2 apart. If you own a OnePlus phone, Nate noted that "there are some smart software features" that could make this tablet a better option than an iPad or Galaxy Tab. But, as Nate points out, "the Android software situation, as always, is a rather unimpressive mixed bag." He called out multitasking and a lack of apps that make good use of larger screens as two areas that need improvement.</p> 
<p>Still, for $550 (and currently going for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:OnePlus;elmt:;cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d8d4d385-7f93-4537-83d1-d5fb47d219ec&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OnePlus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbmVwbHVzLmNvbS91cy9idXktb25lcGx1cy1wYWQtMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTIwMjBjOGUtNjE5Zi00OGIzLWEyYjgtMzIxMTU2YTBkOGFmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbmVwbHVzLmNvbS91cy9idXktb25lcGx1cy1wYWQtMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeuMd2xYTLGoLxofH2YyXxSYOvRzHTtvqhqpVKqM5Yvf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fbuy-oneplus-pad-2" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.oneplus.com/us/buy-oneplus-pad-2">$499 direct from OnePlus</a>), Nate thinks the Pad 2 is a fair value. "I still can't recommend it over an iPad, but at least it doesn't break the bank."</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-upcomingon-the-horizon">Upcoming/on the horizon</h2> 
<p>Like I said at the start of this recap, there are plenty of gadgets hiding in our homes, ready to be tested. There's plenty more to come, including new Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips, as well as cameras, earbuds and more. If anyone watching this week's news were so inclined, they could probably make a very educated guess as to what we're getting ready to publish reviews of, especially given established timelines from previous years. That's all I'll say for now.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I did want to say how thankful we are for your patience as we make it through this intensely hectic time of year, and you may see reviews go up this month that are updated after publish with additional details. This might be done in an effort to get articles up in a timely manner while still being able to provide comprehensive insight on our experiences over time. For instance, my Pixel Watch 3 review went up on Monday, but I was able to update it on Wednesday morning with a whole section on the Wear OS and Fitbit app experience.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's not anything that was new or that impacted my score, but was simply extra detail that I didn't have the time to write up while concurrently preparing for the iPhone event. With the packed tech launch calendar coming up, you may see us adopt a similar approach on reviews that might have tight deadlines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As always, we appreciate all your time reading and watching our work. Have a wonderful weekend.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-foldable-wearable-floatable-140035783.html?src=rss]]></description>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman has told OpenAI staff members during their weekly meeting that the company is changing its rather convoluted non-profit corporate structure next year, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/13/sam-altman-openai-non-profit-structure-change-next-year/"><em>Fortune</em></a>. The CEO said OpenAI will move away from being controlled by a non-profit entity and will transition into a more traditional for-profit organization. He didn't delve into the specifics of how the company will achieve that goal and what OpenAI's corporate structure will look like exactly. A spokesperson only told <em>Fortune</em> that it remains "focused on building AI that benefits everyone" and that non-profit is "core to [its] mission and will continue to exist."</p>
<p>OpenAI started as a non-profit organization in 2015 that relied on money from donors. In a page <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">explaining its structure</a>, it said that it only raised $130.5 million in total donations over the years, which it says made it clear that "donations alone would not scale with the cost of computational power and talent required to push [its] core research forward." The then-purely non-profit organization created a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-sues-openai-and-sam-altman-for-allegedly-ditching-non-profit-mission-160722736.html">for-profit</a> subsidiary in order to solve that problem. As <em>Fortune</em> explains, OpenAI's non-profit entity currently controls its for-profit arm, which in turn controls a holding company that takes investments from companies like Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It used to go by at least two different names —<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-oculus-quest-mixed-reality.html"> Oculus Connect </a>and then <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-connect-170026683.html">Facebook Connect</a> — but whatever the moniker, Meta’s fall event is still a big showcase for the company’s latest and greatest achievements in the virtual reality and mixed reality space. Much like last year, we can likely predict the biggest news coming out of Meta Connect 2024 with just two acronyms: AI and AR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like every other big tech firm this year, Meta will be desperate to demonstrate how it plans to stay relevant in a future powered by AI.  And now that we&#39;re seven months beyond the launch of Apple&#39;s Vision Pro, which arrived alongside a short-lived spike in interest in augmented reality (AR), Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is likely eager to show off his own plans to make AR a reality.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Zuckerberg isn&#39;t as hot on the metaverse as he was when he renamed his company, the union of AI and AR is one way he can still make the dream of persistent virtual worlds come true. It might look less like <em>Ready Player One</em>, but if AR glasses actually take off, they could still let Meta control another piece of our digital world. And to help get them there, delivering an updated inexpensive VR headset couldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, here are a few things we expect to see at Meta Connect 2024, which kicks off virtually on September 25 and runs for two days.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-09/173e3fb0-743c-11ef-9bf7-d4e4b1e34b22" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-09/173e3fb0-743c-11ef-9bf7-d4e4b1e34b22" style="height:1278px;width:1300px;" alt="Meta Orion glasses" data-uuid="9555bf3c-4196-34ea-9721-5be6a35d609e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure>
<p><strong>Orion AR glasses</strong></p>
<p>After reportedly killing <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-has-reportedly-killed-its-apple-vision-pro-competitor-184446962.html">a pricey next-generation mixed reality headset</a>, which was meant to compete with the Apple Vision Pro, Meta is instead focusing on a pair of augmented reality glasses, codenamed Orion, as its next innovation. As seen in the background of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C27tpcvx77t">one Mark Zuckerberg photo</a> (above) , and later somewhat <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C9toN3Xxewd">confirmed by him</a>, Orion resembles a pair of chunky hipster frames.</p>
<p>Unlike the Quest 3, which fully consumes your vision and uses cameras to show you a low-quality view of the world, Orion could let you see the real world like a normal pair of glasses. But, like Magic Leap  and Microsoft&#39;s HoloLens before it, Meta’s glasses could layer holographic imagery on top of your reality. The key difference, of course, is that it appears to be far less cumbersome than those devices.</p>
<p>“The glasses are, I think, going to be a big deal,” Zuckerberg said in an <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m88OV10vRLA">interview on the Blueprint Podcast</a> (<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/report-meta-ar-glasses-orion-connect-2024/">via <em>RoadtoVR</em></a>). “We’re almost ready to start showing the prototype version of the full holographic glasses. We’re not going to be selling it broadly; we’re focused on building the full consumer version rather than selling the prototype.”</p>
<p>Back at Meta Connect 2022, Zuckerberg showed off how the company was thinking of AR glasses, together with an intriguing wrist-based controller:</p>
<div id="decad0ff09804d1a8740b99308ce4aa7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRWSt4a7n2I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p>&quot;It’s probably our most exciting prototype that we’ve had to date,&quot; Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/21/24011574/meta-cto-andrew-bosworth-interview-ai-ar-glasses">told <em>The Verge</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>last year. &quot;I might get myself in trouble for saying this: I think it might be the most advanced piece of technology on the planet in its domain. In the domain of consumer electronics, it might be the most advanced thing that we’ve ever produced as a species.&quot;</p>
<p>According to <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-first-true-ar-glasses-2027-060946419.html">a leaked Meta roadmap</a>, the company plans to release a new pair of Ray-Ban smart glasses next year which would add a small built-in screen alongside its existing camera, speaker and microphone. That would be followed by Meta’s first pair of consumer AR glasses in 2027. It makes sense that we&#39;ll see some sort of concept device this year. Much like Apple’s Vision Pro was effectively that company’s version of an AR/VR concept car to introduce developers to its notion of &quot;spatial computing,&quot; Meta will need to give developers a way to use its platform so they can build their own AR experiences.</p>

<p><strong>A cheaper Quest 3 variant</strong></p>
<p>Instead of an upgraded headset, all signs point to Meta releasing a stripped-down version of the Quest 3 called the Quest 3S, <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-25/apple-plans-tabletop-robot-while-exploring-mobile-bots-and-humanoid-machines-m09kawex?cmpid=BBD082524_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=240825&amp;utm_campaign=poweron">reports <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman</a>. <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1fapa9v/official_image_of_the_quest_3s_found_in_the_files/?share_id=FPAew1Ecw7JX0bXuSFemr&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">Recent leaked images</a> from Meta’s own Quest Link application has confirmed the headset’s existence. According to Gurman, the company is aiming to make it much cheaper than the current version, reportedly considering price points of $300 or $400, while still delivering an experience close to the Quest 3. It could potentially replace the Quest 2, which remains in the product line priced at $299 long after <a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291-173042930.html">its 2020 release</a>.</p>
<p>So why would Meta do this? There’s a huge performance gap between the Quest 3 and Quest 2, which makes life difficult for developers. With a cheaper device that’s similar to the Quest 3, potentially using the same processor, it would be easier to build games that can scale across two price points. According to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Gurman, Meta has also considered releasing some models of the new headset without any bundled controllers, which would push the price down even further.</p>
<div id="a2c284873e6a4edc9e7d19d0eb8454ec"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKmTpgeV3cw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>More AI, of course</strong></p>
<p>Expect Meta to show off even more ways it’s taking advantage of AI across its Quest headsets and the Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company rolled out multi-modal AI search capabilities on those glasses in January, which allowed you to ask the Meta AI about objects or landmarks you were looking at, or for a quick translation. <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-new-ai-powers-are-impressive-and-worrying-181036772.html">Based on our testing</a>, though, those features were surprisingly half-baked.</p>
<p>Meta will likely discuss ways it’s improving those existing features by implementing its <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://llama.meta.com/">Llama 3.1 large language model</a> (LLM), which it’s positioning as an open source competitor to Google and OpenAI’s LLMs. In particular, the company notes that Llama 3.1 offers dramatically improved translation, math and general knowledge capabilities. There’s certainly room for Meta to introduce new AI capabilities powered by Llama 3.1 in the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but given their limited processing power and battery life, we’ll probably have to wait for an updated model before we see anything truly groundbreaking.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once you’ve decided <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">which Apple iPad</a> you want, the next step is finding the right accessories. For getting work done, you’ll likely want a mouse and keyboard. For drawing and note-taking, a stylus is the obvious choice, but we also recommend a paper-like screen protector for added texture. Power banks let you recharge your slate whenever you need to and a hub helps you get the most out of your iPad’s processing power with connections for wired peripherals. After testing (and owning) iPads over the years, we’ve singled out a dozen-plus accessories that help expand what Apple’s tablets can do.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-which-ipad-generation-do-you-own">Which iPad generation do you own?</h2> 
<p>Before you splurge on a bunch of accessories, you should double check which <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">iPad generation</a> you own. There are a couple of ways to do this: first, you can check the back of your tablet for its model number, which will start with an “A” and end with a series of numbers. You can also go into Settings on your iPad, then General and look up the model number in the top section. If you see a series of letters and numbers with a slash (“/“) in it, just tap that to reveal the iPad’s true model number.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The most important iPad details to consider before buying accessories are the charging port, screen size and Apple Pencil compatibility. Most iPads now have USB-C charging, save for the 9th-gen iPad that still uses a Lightning connector (and is on the way out anyway). Make sure to double check your iPad’s screen size before buying a case or a screen protector. As for the Apple Pencil, check out this guide to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-pencil-lineup-is-a-mess-so-heres-a-guide-to-which-one-you-should-buy-190040913.html">how to choose the right Apple Pencil</a> to make sure you're getting the right one for the tablet you have.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-paper-feel-screen-protectors">Paper-feel screen protectors</h2> 
<p>If you’re a heavy user of the Apple Pencil or some other stylus, you should consider getting a screen protector for your new iPad. They pull double-duty: Not only do they act as a first line of defense if your iPad goes careening onto concrete, but they can also enhance the digital drawing and writing experience. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down as quickly.</p>

                                        <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4sn7e783" data-original-link="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4sn7e783"><ins>revealed</ins></a> it will allow iPad users in the EU to install third-party app stores on their tablets (without having to sideload them) starting on September 16. You'll need to install iPadOS 18, which will be available broadly on Monday, to do so.</p>
<p>Back in April, the European Commission designated iPadOS as a "core platform service," meaning that like iOS, the App Store and Safari, the operating system is subject to stricter rules under the bloc's Digital Markets Act. As <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/alternative-app-stores-allowed-on-the-ipad-in-the-eu-starting-september-16/" data-original-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/alternative-app-stores-allowed-on-the-ipad-in-the-eu-starting-september-16/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, Apple had six months to update iPadOS so that it complied with the DMA, which included opening up the platform to third-party app marketplaces.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Epic Games has already pledged to bring its app marketplace to iPadOS, meaning that folks in the EU should be able to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/fortnite-returns-to-ios-in-the-eu-as-the-epic-games-store-debuts-on-mobile-142457411.html">play <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Fall Guys</em> natively on compatible iPads</a> in the near future. Several other third-party app stores have arrived on iOS in the EU since Apple <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-174-is-here-enabling-third-party-app-stores-in-the-eu-185812797.html"><ins>added official support in March</ins></a>.</p>
<p>While the likes of <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-emulator-delta-hits-the-ios-app-store-no-sideloading-required-201158987.html"><ins>AltStore PAL</ins></a> and the Epic Games Store aren't subject to Apple's usual app review policies, the company notarizes them for security purposes. The developers of third-party app marketplaces also need to <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pple-details-how-third-party-app-stores-and-payments-will-work-in-europe-183931334.html"><ins>pay a Core Technology Fee</ins></a> to Apple once they meet certain thresholds (the EU <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-eu-is-investigating-apple-meta-and-google-over-fees-and-self-preferencing-124147179.html"><ins>opened an investigation</ins></a> into this fee in March).</p>
<p>One other key change coming to iPads with the rollout of iPadOS 18 is under the surface, but one that may ultimately change how EU users browse the web on their iPads. Apple will allow third-party browsers to use their own engines on iPadOS instead of having to employ its own WebKit. This means that the likes of Mozilla and Google will be able to offer iPad versions of Firefox and Chrome that <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-blink-ios-experiment-220001141.html"><ins>run on their own tech</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipads-will-support-third-party-app-stores-in-europe-starting-september-16-180414833.html?src=rss]]></description>
